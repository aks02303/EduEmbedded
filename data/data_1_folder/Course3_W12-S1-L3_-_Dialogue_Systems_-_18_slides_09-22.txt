Welcome back to
Natural Language Processing.
We're going to continue with a very
short segment on dialogue systems.
So dialogue systems are a very important
component of computer science and
natural language processing because
they are very popular these days.
So you have a for example,
a person interacting with a computer and
asking questions and getting answers.
So I'm going to show you first an example
of a video that you can watch yourselves
on YouTube.
The link is shown here.
It's a famous skit from more than 50
years ago by Abbott and Costello.
They are having a serious misunderstanding
when they discuss the names
of baseball players.
So the name of the skit is Who's on first.
The funny thing about this skit is that
the name of one of the players is Who.
So when one of the participants in
the conversation says something like,
who's on first,
he's not really asking a question.
He's actually making a statement saying
that who is the name of
the person on first base.
And the second person
doesn't understand this and
asks some follow up questions, and so on.
And it turns out that the name of the,
Second baseman is What and
the third baseman is I Don't Know.
So, you can imagine how
fun this dialogue can get.
So, I encourage you to
watch it by yourselves.
So, as you see,
dialogue has some interesting properties.
The very least is that it
involves more than one person.
Therefore, whenever somebody asks
a question, they're usually expecting
an answer, and if one of the participants
in the dialogue makes a pause,
that means that it may be time for
the other person to start talking again.
So this idea is called turn-taking.
So two people, or
more than two people, take turns.
There are some specific rules for
turn-taking, so for example,
people are not expected to interrupt
others unless there is a good reason, or
unless a lot of time has elapsed.
So there's an idea of a default
turn-taking role, which says, more or
less, that you say what you want to say
and then you give a chance to the other
participant to say whatever
they want to say and so on.
So this is the default and
there are many exceptions to it.
So the only places where it is possible
to have a change of turns, is when
you're at a relevant place for example,
after a pause or after a question.
Barge-in is possible, and
it has to be analyzed separate.
Another interesting property of dialogue
systems is something called conversational
impliciture.
So, an implictature has
some shared information
between the participants and the dialogue.
So, here's an example.
If A says, How can I help you?
And then B says, I am looking for
a Thai restaurant, so
this is a typical example of dialogue.
So what is clear is that the first
person is willing to help,
the second person is looking for
specific past run and
then, they probably know in what
neighborhood they're located.
So, the first person is not going to send
a second person to a Thai restaurant in
a different location or
to a Mexican restaurant.
So, this is part of their
shared information.
So, implicature is the term that
refers to meaningful inferences that
the listener can make.
So, we're going to see some
examples of this later.
So Grice's maxims refer to some properties
of dialogue that make it easier
to understand and more logical.
So here are some of them.
So the first one is the so
called maxim of quantity.
So the idea is that you want to make your
contribution to the dialogue informative.
You don't want to say either too much or
too little.
Second one is the maxim of quality.
So you want to say only things
that you believe are true.
And don't say things for
which you lack evidence.
The third one is the maxim of relevance.
Fourth one is maxim of manner, so you want
to avoid ambiguities in the discourse.
So dialogue is a collaborative endeavor.
And it is expected that all participants
are going to make an effort
to make it possible for the other
party to understand what is going on.
So here is an actual
problem on Grice's maxims.
I am going to show it to you very briefly,
and then I am going to pause so
that you can try to solve it on your own.
So the problem is about a robot that
teaches players how to play a card game.
The robot's name is GGG,
and it has to follow
the following maxims on Grice's list,
relevance, manner, quantity, and quality.
And it is that it gives you
hints as to which cards to play.
So please read this carefully and
try to solve this problem.
And the goal here is to
understand the following things.
If the robot gives us a particular piece
of advice, you have to determine whether
that sentence violates any of the maxims,
and if you ask which one.
So, this is the first
part of the question, and
then there's two additional components.
And then, on the next line,
I'm going to show you the answer.
So, the final thing that I want
to mention about this course,
dialogue analysis, is speech acts.
So speech acts are some
specific expressions that
are not just factual statements.
So for example, assertives, things like
suggesting, putting forward, swearing,
boasting, and concluding.
Directives, things like asking, ordering,
requesting, inviting, advising,
and begging.
Commissives that equals promising,
planning, vowing, betting and opposing.
Expressives for example, thanking,
apologizing, welcoming and deploring.
Finally, declarations,
things like I resign or you're fired.
So if I say I resign, I'm not just saying
that I resign, I'm also taking an action.
And if I say you're fired as
a result of the sentence,
the second person has lost their job.
So some action has taken place
even though it's just a sentence.
To conclude the segment I'm going to
go over the typical architecture of
a dialogue system.
So it involves typically
the following components.
An understanding component,
which makes sense of the sentences
asked by the human.
Then a dialogue manager, which based
on what it has heard from the user,
continues to carry on the dialogue
by asking followup questions.
I should also say, there exists
so-called mixed initiative dialogue
systems where the system may be
the one who interacts with the user.
Then there's a task manager.
So based on the dialogue manager
the system may decide for
example to send a query to a database
of let's say airplane reservations or
some search engine.
The output of the task manager is then
sent back to the dialogue manager.
Which generates an answer to the user and
then this can go in a loop if necessary.
For example, the generation may involve
some follow-up questions and then
there may be some additional rounds of
understanding in dialogue management and
generation until the task
has been completed.
And one other interesting property
of this course that I didn't mention
before is the idea of prosody.
Prosody is a property of text that
deals with issues like Rhythm,
and Intonation, and Stress.
So there has been a lot of work
in the speech literature and
the natural language literature of
identifying those kind of prosodic
expressions and features in documents
especially spoken documents.
Those are important because a lot of text,
especially in user-generated content and
social media is used to express
emotions and emphasis and so.
So it's very important for
good natural language understanding system
to be fluent in people's use of prosody.
So here's an example of one specific
instance of prosody called emphasis.
I'm going to show you one sentence and
then I want to propose seven different
ways to pronounce it, and you will
see that each of those ways to pronounce
it will have a very different meaning.
So here's the sentence.
I never said she stole my money.
And the tasks that you have right now in
front of you is to say the sentence seven
times and each time you should emphasize
one of the words in the sentence in order.
So the first time you say you
emphasize I then never and so on.
And try to see how much the meaning of the
sentence changes because of this emphasis.
So clearly this is something that
you can only, the computer can only,
understand in the case of spoken text.
If you just have it in text, you would
never be able to recognize the emphasis.
Although it is completely possible that
if somebody wanted to convey the same
idea in written text,
they could use something like italics or
bold face or stars around words to
indicate which word they're emphasizing.
So there's a lot of interesting
work that has been done and
that can still be done in that optic
community on prosody recognition.
And also I should mention
prosody generation.
If you want to produce
more effective text,
you would want to use
automatic prosody generation.
So, this concludes
the segment on dialogue, and
I'm going to see you in the next segment.
