In the next course segment,
we are going to discuss why
natural language processing has
challenges that come from text.
Specifically, we are going to look
at an example of a news story that
talks about an event that
happened recently in Brazil.
The story is about a candidate for
president who died in a plane crash.
We want to build a system that
would understand this story and
be able to answer questions about it.
For example what happened and
where and so on.
I'm going to now highlight a few
of the pieces of the document.
For example the word they.
The phrase is expected and then an entire
sentence and a few more phrases.
I have a specific reason
to highlight those.
Can you figure out why
I highlighted them and
why each of them presents a different
sort of challenge to the computer?
Oh, the answer will be on the next slide.
Well the first sentence is Brazil crowds
attend funeral of late candidate Campos,
the reason why I chose the sentence
is because it tells us
the main event of the story.
So computers have to be able to
understand entire sentences and
figure out how they
relate to what happened.
The second sentence is, Mr Campos'
jet crashed in bad weather in Santos.
So, this is a background event.
The current event is the funeral,
and the background event in which
the context of which the funeral
happens is that the jet crashed.
And the third sentence is
also very interesting,
it says, Mr Campos' Socialist Party
is expected to appoint.
So this is not an event,
this is a speculation about
what may happen in the future.
President Dilma Rousseff.
Well this sentence gives
you a property of a person.
It tells you that Dilma Rousseff
is the president of Brazil.
And they attended a funeral mass.
Here the world they only makes sense in
the context of the previous sentence.
And in this particular case,
what's important is that the word
they refers to the hundreds of thousands
of people who attended the funeral.
So this is known in natural language
processing as a pronominal reference
to an entity in the previous sentence.
There are many different genres of text,
and
each of them presents different
challenges to computers.
Let's see what are the most
common kinds of text that
computers are likely to encounter.
Well they will include the most obvious
genres of texts, such as blogs and emails,
press releases, chats on the internet,
debates and so on.
So on the left hand side here
I have a small snap shot.
You're not expected to read it, you can
go to the website, create a debate and
see what that's site is all about.
I'm just going to describe
it here really quickly.
Anybody can go to this website and
post a controversial topic.
For example, is Manchester United
the best football team ever.
Or in this particular example
do you think that schools should
provide more tests for
developmentally challenged people.
And you can decide whether you're
on the yes side or the no side, and
then everybody can participate
in this discussion and
enter arguments on both sides.
So this kind of text presents interesting
challenges because we want to understand
what each person's opinion is, whether
they're on the yes side or the no side.
The second example here is from Wikipedia.
It includes an entry about
a specific politician, Tony Blair.
And it can be used to understand the basic
events and facts about his biography.
Now let's look at the more
challenging piece of text.
This is a scientific paper,
it's title itself already tells you
how difficult this topic can be.
Induction of
Influenza Specific Mucosal Immunity by
an Attenuated Recombinant Sendai Virus.
I've extracted some of the text from
the sentence, from this document, sorry.
And I want to show you, some of
the specific challenges to computers.
So the first thing is this phrase here,
Sendai virus, this is a named entity.
It's specifically a virus and it has
to be recognized by the system as such.
There are other examples
of named entities.
For example, human parainfluenza
virus type one or HPIV1.
Then Sendai virus is
mentioned a few more times.
Luciferase Green Fluorescent Protein or
GFP, those are all examples
of named entities.
There are also examples of speculation,
for example reported and
suggesting, which are in purple.
We have instances of species, for
example the words human, mice, ferrets.
We have cell types, for
example, mesoepithelial cells.
We have also facts, and
we have references,
the things in the square brackets
are references throughout the papers.
So, a computer will need to understand
the purpose of each of those words and
phrases and references in order to
understand the content of the document.
So another interesting type of,
documents that can be challenging
to computers are medical records.
Medical records have two
interesting properties.
First of all, they're often
the result of transcriptions and
they don't contain grammatical sentences.
And the second problem with medical
records is that when they're used for
research purposes they have
to be anonymized, so for
example in this, medical record here.
The name of the person has been
changed to, something that is not,
personally identifiable information.
A more interesting challenge comes
from literary texts, or fiction texts,
those can be, very difficult for
computers to process.
I want to show you some examples
from a project, Gutenberg,
which is an online digital
library that contains, old books.
Just some examples.
Some classic books like Ulysses.
You can see that there
are some proper names that
are difficult to understand if you
don't know the context of the story.
There's some rare words such
as waggoner here, and so on.
Another example is from Jane Eyre,
here you have again short,
relatively short sentences.
But then we also have
sentences in parentheses
which indicates some
additional information.
And another example from the Wizard of Oz.
Which is a little bit longer but,
luckily, for
a computer program it has relatively short
sentences that are easy to understand.
Now, on the other end of the spectrum we
have some really long literary sentences,
for example try to parse this sentence,
and
this is just one sentence that
occupies the entire screen.
It talks about again,
obscure names of people.
It uses some words that are not
even words in the English language.
Can you guess where this text is from?
Well, on the previous slide I showed
you an excerpt of, Gravity's Rainbow,
this is a book that is known for
its, use of very arcane words and
complicated, sentences and
also fairly complicated plot structure.
Another such work that you may have heard
about is Finnergans Wake by James Joyce,
which is probably one of the most
difficult books to read.
And translating or understanding poetry
can be even more difficult, because,
in addition to the constraints
that are imposed by language,
you also have constraints that are imposed
by the metric structure line and
the structure of the individual line.
So in the next item we're
going to talk about some funny
sentences that present specific challenges
to natural language processing systems.
