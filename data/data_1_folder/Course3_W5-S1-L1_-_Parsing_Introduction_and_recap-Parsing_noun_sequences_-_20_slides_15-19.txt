Welcome to the natural
language processing course.
Today we're going to continue
with one of the most interesting
topics in natural language processing,
namely parsing.
I want to remind you that last
time we looked at parsing already,
and I wanted to bring out that
parsing human languages is very different
from parsing programming languages.
So when we parse a programming language,
we have to parse statements,
and punctuation and variables.
However, all of those
are designed to be unambiguous.
So for example this C program here can
only be interpreted in one possible way.
There's a main function and
then inside the main function there's some
variable declarations, and while loop and
each of those gets converted into
binary code in a very unambiguous way.
Parsing human language,
on the other hand, is very different.
I will give you some examples to
show you why it can be a challenge.
The first problem is coordination scope.
Look at the sentence,
small boys and girls are playing.
This sentence can have two
different interpretations.
The adjective small can attach to
either boys, in which case we have boys
was small and girls who are or
are not small, both of those are playing,
and the alternative interpretation
is that both boys and
girls are small and they are both playing.
The second example is what is known
as prepositional phrase attachments.
A prepositional phrase is a phrase that
starts with a preposition as the name
suggests.
So in the sentence I saw the man with
the telescope, with the telescope is
a prepositional phrase, because it
starts with the preposition with.
Now let's try to interpret the sentence.
One interpretation is that, the man
that I saw was carrying a telescope,
and another interpretation is that,
I saw the man using my telescope.
As you can see, those are two very
different interpretations, and
it is difficult, in fact, impossible,
to tell which one was intended.
The third example is about gaps.
Sometimes a sentence may skip some words
if they can be understood from the context
and the sentence can still make sense, but
it may be very difficult
to process computationally.
Look at the example.
Mary likes physics, but hates chemistry.
If we want to find out who likes physics,
the sentence tells us right away
it's Mary, but who hates chemistry?
Well it's still Mary, but the sentence
doesn't say this implicitly, we have
to infer the subject of hates chemistry
from the structure of the sentence.
The fourth example is about the use
of some words as either particles or
prepositions.
In English the word up can be
particle as in, to run up.
For example, to run up a bill,
in which case up modifies ran or
it can also be the beginning of a
prepositional phrase like up a large bill.
Obviously up a large bill is not
a valid prepositional phrase,
but you can have another sentence that is,
she ran up a large hill.
In which case, up a large hill
is a prepositional phrase, and
how do we know that this is
a different interpretation?
Well, it's very easy.
We can move up a large bill to the
beginning of the sentence, we can say up
a large hill, she ran, but
we can not say up a large bill, she ran.
So for example with hill We have
an opposite preposition, and
in the example with bill,
up is a particle.
And the fifth example for now is the
difference between gerunds and adjectives.
Ing words in English can be either
gerunds which is verbal forms or
they can be used as adjectives.
So in the example here,
we have one interpretation.
Playing cards can be expensive as
in to play cards can be expensive,
because you lose money
when you play cards.
At the same time, another interpretation
could be that, playing cards,
as in a specific type of cards.
What kind of cards?
Playing cards can be expansive.
So in parsing our sentence
can be represented
using a phrase structure formalism.
This is a very simple example here
we have, Buster chased a cat.
Buster is a proper noun which is
labeled with NNP in our pack set.
Chased is a verb, the D at the end of verb
stands for past tense as in chase ed.
A is a determiner and cat is a common noun
which is labeled with NN in our gram.
Now we can start combining
those words into phrases.
Our cat is a noun phrase that
consists of a determiner and a noun.
Chased a cat is a verb phrase that
consists of a verb, chased, and
a noun phrase, a cat.
And then at the top level
we have a noun phrase,
Buster, combined with a verb phrase,
chased a cat, to form a sentence, S.
Okay, so now,
we're going to look into two specific
problems in parsing in more detail.
The first problem is what we
call parsing noun sequences.
In English, very often,
a noun can modify another noun.
An example of this is fish tank.
What is a fish tank?
Well, a fish tank is a kind of tank.
Specifically a kind of
tank that holds fish.
Let's look now at the very similar
construction that has a very different
interpretation.
What is a fish net?
A fish net is a net that
is used to catch fish.
What is fish soup?
Fish soup is soup made with fish.
What is fish oil?
Oil extracted from fish.
As you can see, even though the four
noun phrases have a very similar
structure superficially,
they have very different interpretations.
Some of those can even be ambiguous.
Fish sauce.
What is fish sauce?
Is it a sauce for fish dishes,
or is it sauce made of fish?
It could be either one.
In English when you have
a noun-noun compound,
most of the time the head of the compound
is the second word in the pair.
So for example, college junior and
junior college look very similar,
they have the same words.
However a college junior
is a kind of junior,
specifically one who goes to
college rather than high school.
Whereas as a junior college is
a kind of college as opposed
to say a senior college,
or a guided college.
Well I said that,
in English typically the head of a two
word noun phrase is the second noun but
we have exceptions.
The head first rule can
also appear sometimes.
So an attorney general is an exception.
It's not a kind of general.
It's rather a kind of attorney, but again,
those kind of phrases
are relatively rare in English.
Now what about adjectives?
In some cases, words like college and
college junior can be considered as
adjectives because they
modify the second noun.
In other cases, we have explicit
adjectives as part of the noun phrase.
For example, New Mexico,
new is clearly an adjective.
In general manger, the word general
is an adjective rather than a noun.
It turns out that in English,
people don't always agree.
So, when they're asked to label general
manger, they often say that it's
an adjective followed by a noun, but just
as often they say that it's two nouns.
Now, noun phrases consisting of
nouns are not limited to two nouns.
Look at the example on
the bottom of the page.
What is a luxury car dealership?
Well, there are two
possible interpretations,
at least two,
that it's a dealership for luxury cars,
or it's a car dealership
that is very luxurious.
Now, the interpretations
of this non phrase can be
connected to the structure of the phrase.
So let's look at an example.
Detroit Tigers is clearly a noun
phrase that consists of two nouns.
However, if we look at
Detroit Tigers general manager,
we know that it really consists of two
noun phrases, Detroit Tigers followed
by general manager, which are combined
into a noun phrase themselves.
However, with four consecutive nouns,
we can have many other interpretations.
Let's see first what
happens with three words.
Salt Lake City has three words.
We can either combine first salt and
lake, and
the interpretation in that case would
be a city that is at Salt Lake.
Or, we can have a city
that's called Lake City, and
somehow use the word salt to modify that,
in this case it's pretty obvious that it's
the first interpretation that matters.
The second one is periods, and
nobody would even think about it.
Now what happens with four words?
Can you think of the way that we should
put parenthesis around those four words so
that we get the only reasonable
interpretation of the sentence?
The answer is on the next slide.
Okay so I asked you a question about the
interpretation of Salt Lake City mayor.
And obviously the solution is the one
the you can see here, Salt and
Lake are combined first.
Then Salt Lake is combined with City, that
gives us the kind of city that we want.
And finally, Salt Lake City mayor
is the mayor of Salt Lake City.
So this representation using parenthesis
is very common in natural language
processing.
It allows us to write very compacted
presentations of sentences and phrases.
We don't have to refer to
phrase structure or diagrams.
Let's look at a second example here.
((Detroit Tigers) (general manager)).
As you can see now, we're putting
the parentheses in a different location.
We first want to group together Detroit
and Tigers, and then general and manager,
and finally combine
the two pairs into one.
The next, actually that's a mistake.
It should be
Leland Stanford Junior University.
So the question here to the students is,
if you have a phrase like
Leland Stanford Junior University,
which by the way is the official title of
this university on the West coast,
there are two possible interpretations.
One of which is pretty obvious,
but wrong, and
the second one is less obvious,
but correct.
So, what are those?
You will see the answer on the next slide.
Okay, so the question was,
Leland Stanford Junior University,
what are the two possible interpretations?
Well, one of them is that
Leland Stanford is a person.
Leland Stanford Junior is the son of
Leland Stanford Senior, apparently, and
then finally the university is
named after Leland Stanford Junior.
Now, let's do a little
bit of combinatorics.
We noticed that if the noun phrase
consists of two nouns, then we only
have one possible interpretation and
that is A and B are combined together.
This is the case of Detroit Tigers.
There's only one way to combine the two.
Now, if we have three nouns, then there
are two possible interpretations.
A connects to B first, and then the group
A and B connects to C or, alternatively
we can combine B and C together and
then group them together with A.
Now, my question to you is,
if we have four nouns,
how many different
interpretations are there?
So one of them is shown here.
It's A B connected, C and D connected,
and both of them connected to each other,
just like the Detroit Tigers.
Can you think of the total number
of ways to combine four nouns?
The answer is on the next slide.
Well it turns out that with four nouns you
can have five different interpretations.
This is not a very obvious answer most
people will say either four or six, and
only when they look at those five do they
realize that the correct answer is five.
So what we can do is do the Detroit
Tiger's general manager example,
that's the one shown on the first line.
We can also group the last two words,
then add the second one,
then the first one, and so on.
You can see that there are really five
different ways to group four nouns.
Okay, now the question to you is what
happens if we have more than four nouns?
Here's an example with five.
We group A and B first, then we group C
and D, then we add D to the cluster CD,
and we finally group the two smaller
clusters into a group of five nouns.
So my question to you is,
how many different groupings of
five consecutive nouns there are.
All the answers on the next slide.
Well, it turns out that the solution
is known as the nth Catalan number.
A Catalan here is not a reference
to the Catalan language.
It's rather a reference to a Belgian
mathematician whose last name was Catalan.
The closed form solution here is
C subscript n is one divided by
n + 1 times 2n choose n, for
any n greater than or equal to zero.
So the first few Catalan numbers
are shown here, it's one and two.
That's for the cases where
n is equal to zero and one.
And then when n is equal to three,
we have two combinations,
then for n equals four we have five
combinations, as you saw earlier.
Then the numbers increase rather fast,
14, 42, 132, and so on.
Note that those are not powers of two,
those are not factorials,
it's a completely different sequence.
This sequence is commonly known
by its index in the online
Encyclopedia of
Integer Sequences under A000108.
And you can visit the URL
below on your own and
investigate the sequence and
others in more detail.
It turns out that Catalan numbers appear
very often in math in many different
locations.
In addition to parses
of sequences of words,
they appear in two other very
interesting geometrical cases.
The one on the left is the number
of different ways in which
a convex polygon with n + 2 sides
can be cut into triangles by
connecting vertices with straight lines,
and
you can see that there are 14 different
ways to do this when n + 2 = 6.
So in our case, that's n = 4.
An example on the right is
the number of monotonic paths
along the edges of a grid that
consists of n x n square cells and
the constraint is that the path
should not pass above the diagonal.
So the first example here is one
where you go East, East, East,
East then North, North, North, and North.
The second one is East, East, East,
Northeast, North, North, North.
You get the idea.
As you can see there are 14 ways
to get from the bottom left
corner to the top right corner
using this set of constraints.
So you see that Catalan numbers
are very versatile, and
appear in many different places,
not just in natural language parsing.
So this concludes the section of
parsing noun phrase sequences.
The next set of slides will be about
prepositional phrase attachment.
