So this new segment is about
morphology and the lexicon.
So when people learn new words, they store
them in what is known in linguistics and
psychology as the mental lexicon.
It is used to store the meaning,
the pronunciation, and the part of speech,
among other things.
So if I tell you to store a word like cat,
you will know that this is a little,
furry creature that says meow,
you know that it's pronounced cat,
that it's a cuh, tuh, and
you know that it's a noun.
Sometimes you may not know all
of this information, and yet
still be able to store this
information in the mental lexicon.
For example, if you see the word wug for
the first time,
you may not what it's part of speech is.
You could probably figure
out it's pronunciation,
and you probably don't
know what it's meaning is.
But if I told you that wug is a noun,
and that it means a small creature,
you can use it in a sentence,
because you would know the part of
speech that the meaning can say.
For example things like,
I saw a wug today, or a wug walked by.
Similarly a word like cluvious,
even if you don't know its meaning,
you may be able to infer
some information about it,
because most words in English that
have this form are adjectives.
You can even reason about words
that you haven't seen before.
You can compare traftful and
traftless, and
figure out that they're
most likely opposites.
Because there are many
pairs of words in English
that have those particular endings,
and have autonomy relationship.
So one of the things that
we're interested in today,
is how to interpret those
words morphologically.
So if you take a word like, cluvious.
Can you figure out what it's ending is,
and why you think that it's an adjective?
So, people have intuition, they have
a grammar that they are born with
that helps them understand words
that they have not seen before.
And they can also have this
property called productivity,
which allows them to create new words and
have them different things.
Let's look now at some of the words
that you store in your mental lexicon.
A word like runs.
Clearly it has two possible
meanings in English.
In one of the cases,
it is a noun plural, and
in the second case it is a verb
in third person singular.
So clearly, its part of speech changes,
its meaning changes, its pronunciation
doesn't seem to change in this
particular case, but it's ambiguous.
So there has to be a way for people to
store ambiguous words in their mental
lexicon, and this disambiguate them on the
fly when they pronounce or read sentences.
There are also some special cases of
words that are stored as what is known as
allomorphs.
For example cats is a derivative of cat.
It means a plural of a singular cat.
But there are some
special cases like oxen,
which is formed irregularly
as a plural of ox.
The past tense of play is played, but
one of the past tenses of swing is swung,
which is again formed irregularly.
So those words have to be stored in
the lexicon somehow, and they may not
be obtainable directly by following
some morphological derivation like cats.
So words have a lot of affixes.
They include things like prefixes that
go in front of the stem, suffixes,
endings, and so on.
So one of the subjects of morphology
is called derivation of morphology.
It has to do with understanding
how different forms of words
are created from other words,
by adding different affixes.
So if we look at the word drinkable,
we can say that the whole word
drinkable is an adjective.
You remember that JJ is the standard
label in natural language processing for
adjectives.
We also know that drinkable is
formed by converting the verb drink,
into an adjective by
adding the suffix able.
So we can then represent the whole
word drinkable as some sort of a tree,
which has the verb drink first.
The suffix able, and then those two words
combined form the new word drinkable.
So there are many cases in English where
we have suffixes that change the part of
speech of a word.
So er, is one such example.
So, for example, to sleep is a verb.
And sleeper, which has multiple
meanings is a noun derived from sleep,
by adding the suffix er.
So we can in many cases, infer
the meaning of some of the morphemes.
For example, the morpheme able,
means capable of doing the verb.
The suffix, er, may be a person
who does a certain activity.
So let's try this with
a few of those morphemes.
So ness, for example,
is used to form nouns.
For example, we can have sleepy,
which is an adjective.
Sleepiness is a noun that
is derived from sleepy.
So the affixe ness,
turns an adjective into a noun.
Able, we already saw it can turn a verb
into an adjective, and then we can also
similarly consider the meaning of some
other prefixes and suffixes, such as ing.
Re, for example, is usually used
at the beginning of a word, and
it means to repeat something.
Un, means negation.
For example do and undo.
And finally, er for adjectives means
the comparative form of the adjective.
So in the example that I showed you,
we can draw a diagram that tells us that
the JJ is transformed into a sequence
of a verb followed by the suffix able.
And it turns out that morphemic
rules can be used recursively.
So, a long word like unconcernednesses,
is really formed from concerned,
by adding first the suffix,
ed, then another suffix, ness,
and then negating it, and finally,
adding an extra es at the end for plural.
So, in some cases, it's very easy
to look at a complicated word, and
figure out how it was derived.
But in other cases,
we may have ambiguities.
For example, the word undoable,
as you will see on the next slide,
can have two different
morphological interpretations,
whereas a word like
unbelievable may only have one.
Can you think why this is the case?
So let's look at the examples
on the previous slides.
Undoable, this can be formed
as unable to be done.
So something that is undoable, or
it is something that is able to be undone.
In this case,
it would be analyzed as undo-able.
Now this doesn't apply to unbelievable,
because one of the interpretation's
is the same as for undoable.
It's something that is
unable to be believed.
But the second interpretation, able to
be unbelieved, sounds very unnatural.
So in this case,
we don't have any ambiguity.
Let's look now at some
morphological examples.
In different languages we can have
rules that aren't as simple as
the ones we have in English.
Just adding an S for plural, for example.
So, in the language Pangasinan,
we can have a duplication
of some of the morphing.
So amigo is friend.
Amimigo is the plural for friends.
So, in this case we have a reduplication
of a morphing in the middle of the word.
Similarly, in Samoan,
the word savali means, he travels.
Savavali is the plural for they travel.
We can have circumfixes.
For example, in German the word
spielen is the infinitive
of the verb to play, and
gespielt is the past form form it.
So in this case we have a circumfix,
because part of the morphing goes
to the beginning of the word.
The ge part, in part, goes in the end.
In this case, the t form.
We can even look at some
artificial phenomena.
For example, a language that kids
are familiar with is Pig Latin.
In Pig Latin, you take the first syllable
of the word and you move it to the end.
So from happy,
you get something like appyhay.
And there are some other fun languages
like this in other countries.
For example,
Verlan which is a French slang language.
The word Verlan comes from l'envers,
which in French means in reverse.
So if you reverse the syllables
of l'envers you get Verlan.
And it includes words like cefran
which is the Verlan form for
Francais by switching the two syllables.
As well as ripou, which is the switched
version of pourri, which means a crook..
Now let me give an example in English,
you may have heard this expression.
Where are you going?
I'm going to Massa-freakin'-chusetts.
You can insert the phrase like this
in the middle of some word, but
you can not just insert it randomly.
For example, if you have Massachusetts,
you wouldn't be able to say
Ma-freakin'-sachusetts or
Massachu-freakin'-setts.
So clearly, freakin' can not be
inserted in any random place.
Where would you insert it, for
example, in the word education?
Could you say educa-freakin'-tion?
That doesn't sound natural, okay.
But you can probably say,
edu-freakin'-cation.
So the rule is actually that the freakin'
infix is inserted to the left of
the syllable that bears the main stress.
So, as I said earlier,
you can say edu-freakin'-cation.
But you cannot say educa-freakin'-tion,
or e-freakin'-ducation.
And there are some exceptions, but
this rule applies in most cases.
So as I mentioned before,
the morphemes of a word are individual
units of morphological meaning.
They include the stems and
the affixes of the words.
So affixes are prefixes,
suffixes, and endings.
There's some languages that
have concatenative morphology.
Like English, for example, where
the affixes are added to the beginning or
to the end of the word.
But there are also cases of
templatic morphology, as well.
So for example, in Semitic languages.
Here's an example from Hebrew, and
the template for learn is lmd.
It's just a sequence of three consonants.
But if we want to conjugate it or inflect
it, we can get different forms of learn.
For example, lamad,
which is he studied, limed,
which is he taught, and lumad,
which means that he was taught.
So by inserting different sets
of vowels in different places,
we can modify the tense in
the template and form different words.
Now let's look at inflectional morphology,
which is one the main areas of morphology.
Words can have a different inflection
based on tense, such as present,
past and future.
Number, first and second and
third, for example.
I, you, or he or she person.
In English, that's singular and plural,
but other languages have other persons.
For example duo,
which is used for two people.
Moods, things like indicative,
subjunctive, conditional.
Aspect, for example,
progressive, and perfective.
English words have at
most five verb forms.
For example, the word to be has am,
are, was, were, and been.
There are, however,
40 different forms in French.
There are six cases in Russian.
You can look at the website
listed here for some examples.
And there could be as many as 40,000
forms of the same word in Turkish.
For example, there can be a special
form that means you can cause X
to cause Y to dot, dot, dot, to do Z.
So it can have a recursive set of
rules that create really long words.
Morphological analysis is an area of
natural language processing that takes
a word and converts it into
a morphological representation.
This is related to stemming, but
it does more than just stem the work.
It also gives it a part of speech, and
any morphological information
associated with the word.
So for example, the word sleeps is
translated as the infinitive sleep.
Then a label for verb, a label for
third person, and a label for singular.
The word done is translated as
the infinitive for the verb do.
Followed by a label for
the verb, V, and PP, for
which in this case,
stands for past participle.
Now, let me show you some
interesting phenomena
that are related to morphology
in different languages.
So, the first part is an example
of Turkish vowel harmony.
As I mentioned before, our vowels
can be grouped into front and back,
and high and low.
In English, this is a very common
distinction between our vowels.
In Turkish,
there's an additional distinction
between rounded and unrounded vowels.
So every time you have a vowel that
is formed by putting your mouth in
an unrounded position,
you can round your lips like this.
And change the sound to a different vowel.
For example, ee, oo.
So in Turkish,
there are eight vowels in total.
Which form all the possible combinations
of front and back, high and low,
and rounded and unrounded vowels.
So the back vowels are formed
in the back of the mouth.
And the front vowels are formed
in the front of the mouth.
So in vowel harmony we have a principle
that says that within the same word,
you can only have back vowels or
only have front vowels.
There are other languages that have this
property in addition to Turkish, for
example, Hungarian.
So, let's look at an example.
So the suffix da or de in Turkish is used
to indicate location, in, on, or at.
But we use da if the rest of
the vowels in the word are back vowels.
And we use de if the rest of the vowels
in the word are front vowels.
So, let's look at the examples here.
In the room, is odada.
Because the word oda, which means room,
has only back vowels.
And therefore we add da at the end,
which is another back vowel.
Kapi is door, kapida is at the door.
And now I have the examples
with front vowels.
Ev is home, at home is evde.
Gol is lake, golde is at the lake.
And finally, kopru is bridge,
and koprude is on the bridge.
In fact, I want to point
you to a NACLO Problem that
talks about Turkish vowel harmony and
some other interesting phenomena.
You can access it from this website.
And then when you're done solving it,
you can look at the solution
which is available here.
So let's look at another
example from Turkish.
Which shows you how complicated
morphology can be in different languages.
So this is a slide courtesy
of Kemal Oflazer from Qatar.
He shows how one can take an English
sentence, an entire sentence, and convert
it to a single English word by following
the morphological rules of Turkish.
So here's the word in Turkish,
it's the one listed at the bottom.
And it means, if we will be able to make
something, dot, dot, dot becomes strong.
So in the first step,
we start with that sentence.
And then we label, in different colors,
the different modifications to strong.
For example, the future tense will,
the possibility, be able,
and the property of becoming something.
So then we re-order those labels.
To get them in the order
they have to be in Turkish.
So strong is the stem.
And then all of the other pieces
form morphological inflections.
So become is the first that adds las,
and then to make something is tir,
be able is abil,
will is ecek, if is se, and
finally we goes to the very end and
that is the final affix ku.
Which gives us this long
word at the bottom.
And here's that example from Japanese,
which shows you how Japanese
have imported a lot of words from English,
and they use katakana,
which is one of the main alphabets
in Japanese, to represent different
sounds and different morphological
combinations that come from English.
So for example,
right in the middle of the slide we
have [FOREIGN] which stands for coffee.
So you see that the f sound was changed
to [SOUND] and we have those macrons or
bars on top of the two vowels to indicate
that both syllables are long syllables.
And let's look at one more example.
We have, for example, resutoran,
which stands for restaurant.
And the reason why the second syllable
has a vowel in it, resutoran,
is because in Japanese grammar,
the only kinds of syllables
that are allowed are the ones that end
in a vowel with only one exception.
The syllables that end in vowel
followed by the letter n.
So that's why we have to insert
this u in the middle of restaurant.
So now we're going to move on to some
other levels of linguistic analysis.
We looked at morphology,
let's see what comes next.
So one of the other levels is semantics.
The semantics is the study of
the meaning of words and sentences.
And it can be split into lexical
semantics and compositional semantics.
So lexical semantics has to do with
the meaning of individual words.
And the relationships between
the meanings of pairs of words, so
that includes the specific lexical
relationships such as synonyms but
also hypernyms and hyponyms, which
are special terms for more general and
more specific concepts,
antonyms and so on.
We are going to look at
those in more detail.
In one of the future lectures.
So lexical semantics also deals
with the senses of words.
For example, some words that have multiple
senses are known as polysemous words.
It also talks about colocation.
So colocation is a sequence of words that
appear together more frequently than what
you would expect if you just combine
the probabilities of the individual words.
So for example, stock market appears
more frequently than stock and
market, multiplied by each other.
We also have idioms.
Those are specific collocations
that have a meaning that is
not literally inferable
from the components.
So, for example, to kick the bucket, is an
expression in English that means to die.
Obviously it doesn't mean to
kick any particular bucket.
In addition to lexical semantics, we have
compositional semantics, which deals with
understanding the meaning of a sentence
based on the meaning of its components.
We will talk about lexical semantics and
compositional semantics later.
The next level of studying
linguistics is called pragmatics, and
that is the study of how
knowledge about the world and
language conventions interact
with literal meaning.
It covers things like speech acts,
resolution of anaphoric relations, for
example pronouns, and it covers the
modelling of speech acts in dialogue, so
later this semester we're going to
look at pragmatics in more detail.
And there are many other areas of
linguistics which are not directly
related to natural language processing, so
we'll just list them here very briefly.
Social linguistics, which is
interaction of social organization and
language, historical linguistics,
which studies the change of languages
over time, linguistic typology,
that looks at how languages are related
to each other and have common properties.
Language acquisition of first and
second language.
And finally, psycholinguistics,
which is the study of how people produce
and perceive language in real time.
