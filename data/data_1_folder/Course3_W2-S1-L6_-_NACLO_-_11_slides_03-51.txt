So one of the activities that I'm
personally involved with is called NACLO.
This a competition for
high school students who are interested in
linguistics and computational linguistics,
and many of the problems that we use
in this class are related to NACLO.
So I want to give you an idea of what
it stands for, and what it covers.
So NACLO is a competition in linguistics,
but
it covers also many computation
linguistics problems.
It has existed since 2007,
and usually every year, about 2,000
students in the United States and
Canada participate, and the top eight
of them go to the international level.
And here I have listed some
of the ones who did the most
well at the international level.
People like Adam Hestenburg,
Rebecca Jacobs,
and Alex Wades all won many gold
medals at the international level.
There many other countries that do really
well in the international competition.
Places like Russia, the United Kingdom,
the Netherlands, Poland,
Bulgaria, South Korea, and
in recent years, Canada and China.
The international contest
started in about 2003.
The most recent ones were in
Manchester in England last year,
in Beijing most recently, and then
the next one will be in Bulgaria in 2015.
The website for the international
competition is shown here, and
as you can see, it is related to
some other high school competitions,
such as the math and physics and
chemistry and biology competitions.
So let's get to some of the points
that you can see on NACLO.
Some of them are what we
call traditional poems.
They are about, trying to understand
a foreign language, and specifically some
linguistic phenomenon in that language
that you have not seen before.
So I'm just going to go through
those examples very quickly.
This is about ancient Greek, and
the problem was a donkey
in every house in 2007.
Here's one about Japanese
noun compounds from 2008.
Here's one about aligning texts
from two different languages,
in this case Swedish and
Norwegian from 2009.
This is one about a writing system for
the blind in Japan called Tanji.
You have to figure out
how those characters,
which are similar to braille in English,
are used.
This is a, a more computational example
about using finite state automata
to understand how words in the language
called Rotokas from the coast
of New Guinea are formed.
This one's about writing systems,
specifically people have to figure out how
Armenian script works by looking
at the map and the station names.
Some of those names are given in English,
so
you can use your logical thinking to
figure out where they appear on the map.
And the once you have figured out
where they appear on the map,
you have to figure out what
the different symbols mean and
use those symbols to figure out
the names of the remaining stations.
Over the years, there have been more
than one hundred problems used in NACLO.
I have picked here some of
the most interesting computational
problems that you can use to challenge
yourselves as part of this class.
So this was my brief
introduction to NACLO.
Later in this class, we're going to look
at some of the specific problems that we
used in this competition, and I would
like to use this opportunity to encourage
people to submit problems for
future years.
