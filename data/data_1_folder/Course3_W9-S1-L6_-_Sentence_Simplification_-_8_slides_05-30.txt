The next segment is going to
be on sentence simplification.
Sentence simplification is one
the challenges in text summarization.
So far everything that we have discussed
involved extractive summarization where we
take entire sentences and
put them in the output.
Now we're going to briefly look at
going beyond sentence extraction,
specifically taking entire sentences and
cutting off some pieces from
them to make them shorter.
So some of the parts of the sentences that
could potentially go in summaries may be
removed for a variety of reasons.
One of them is that we want to
have more space available for
more important content.
So in order to do this,
we have to figure out which portion of
sentences are the least informative and
prior research has found that those
include things like quotes, appositions.
Just to remind you an apposition is
something like, Barack Obama, comma,
president of the United States, comma.
The second part of the sentence
is an apposition and
ultimately can be removed without hurting
the information content of the summary.
Other things that can be removed in many
cases are some adjectives, some adverbs.
Embedded clauses are often
some of the first to go.
Attribution clauses for
example who said what.
Why do we want to do
sentence simplification?
There are many different applications.
One is for things like subtitling.
Very often there's not enough space on
the screen to include the entire sentence.
It's possible to include
just portions of it instead.
Headline generation, for mobile devices
you may want to produce a shorter version
of a sentence to display in large font
as part of a summary of a mobile device.
So then if the user wants to read more,
they can click on the sentence
instead of the text.
There are also multiple instances where
people have built applications for
the visually impaired people, which
also involves sentence simplification.
So I'm going to go over some examples of
work on sentence simplification starting
by paper by Kevin Knight and
Daniel Marcu from 2000.
So in their paper they use syntactic
information from the sentences,
and they compare two different approaches.
One is a noisy channel base model and
one is based on decision.
And the kind of rules that the have
are based on the constituent tree
of the sentence.
So for example they may want to
convert the rule noun phrase goes to
determiner adjective noun to
one that says noun phrase
goes to determiner noun thereby
dropping the adjective.
So, they have a set of rules like this and
they have used this approach
on a corpus of simplified
sentences from a computer manual.
The so called Ziff Davis corpus.
So here's some examples from that corpus.
You have a full sentence like
the documentation is typical of Epson
quality; excellent.
And then you also have a shorter version
of it that part of the training data.
Documentation is excellent.
As you can see here we have
removed some individual words.
For example, articles,
some adjectives, and
some prepositional phrases in this case.
Here's some more examples.
All of our design goals were achieved and
the delivered performance matches
the speed of the underlying device.
This is a full sentence.
The short sentence is,
all design goals were achieved.
So we are missing possessive,
we are missing
some portions of conjunctive clause,
and also some prepositional phrase.
Okay, so more examples,
I'm not going to read them all.
Let me read this one.
Beyond the basic level, the operations
of the three products vary widely.
So here we are skipping the entire
quote beyond the basic level.
Get the operations of the three
products vary widely.
So one possible source of information for
building sentence compression,
or sentence simplification applications,
comes from a large corpus called
Simple English Wikipedia.
So let me show you what it looks like.
On this slide, I'm going to show
you an entry about the person,
taken directly from the English Wikipedia,
which is full length sentences.
So you can see that a lot
of the information in it is
in long sentences with a lot
of additional information.
For example, oppositions and prepositional
phrases that convey a lot of detail.
You can spend a little bit of time
on this slide to understand what
the general structure of this document is,
and then you should compare it with
the matching entry for the same person
in the Simple English Wikipedia.
It would be nice to see
those side by side.
And you can figure out how often
it can compare which sentences
from one of the documents matches
with sentence from the other one and
how you can use this alignment
to simplify sentences automatically.
So there are many other projects for
text simplification,
but for this course we're
not going to look at that.
We're going to switch now
to a different topic.
