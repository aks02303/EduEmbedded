In the next segment we're
going to have some fun.
I'm going to show you some sentences that
have multiple possible interpretations.
One is literal, and is not funny,
whereas the second one is not the intended
one, and can be sometimes very funny.
So the first such example is,
children make delicious snacks.
Imagine this is a headline
in some newspaper story.
The point of the author
was essentially to report
that some kids were preparing
some snacks that were very tasty.
However, because of the way that the
sentence is constructed syntactically it
also may be interpreted as children
are very tasty when you eat them.
Let me show you a few more such
sentences that have this kind of
unintentional meaning that is funny.
Stolen painting found by tree.
It's as if the tree found the painting.
I saw the Rockies flying to San Francisco.
Here the funny interpretation is one where
the Rockies are flying to San Francisco.
Court to try shooting defendant.
Instead of trying or putting on
trial a defendant of the shooting
we actually want to shoot the defendant.
Ban on nude dancing on Governor's desk.
Red tape holds up new bridges.
Government head seeks arms.
Blair wins on budget, more lies ahead.
Local high school dropouts cut in half.
Hospitals are sued by seven foot doctors.
Dead expected to rise.
Miners refuse to work after death.
Patient at death's door,
doctors pull him through.
And finally, in America a woman
has a baby every 15 minutes.
How does she do that?
So the previous slide showed
you some what I called
classic examples of ambiguous headlines.
This slide is going to show you some
examples that I actually collected on
the Internet recently.
And the first one is Vancouver Police
shoot man holding box cutter.
So the two possible interpretations here
is that the man who was shot was holding
the box cutter which is
probably what was intended.
And the other interpretation
is that the box
cutter was used by
the police to shoot the man.
Another example.
Man armed with box cutters shot by
officers which is the same story.
Police shoot man with box
cutters in Astoria and
police shoot man yielding box cutters,
and police shoot man with box cutters.
In the, third, fourth,
and fifth example we
have an instance of what is known
as prepositional phrase attachment.
Where a prepositional phrase such
as with box cutters can refer to
either the nearest noun,
man, or to the verb, shoot.
So in the case when it refers to
the nearest noun, it modifies it so
the man was carrying the box cutters.
If it modifies the verb.
Then with box cutter modifies,
the way in which the person was shot.
And a few more real headlines, just for
fun, Bulgaria doubles money for parties.
Motorola to hire 300 Android developers.
Massachusetts exhales as bill passes,
heads to Canada.
US eyes returns to the moon.
And finally,
flesh-eating bug survivor goes home.
All those are real,
headlines as you can see from, the URLs.
So, let me now show you some examples
of ambiguous recommendations which will
illustrate different,
issues with natural language.
So, a funny example here is.
A man like him is hard to find.
This is written in reference to
a chronically absent employee.
So the intended interpretation of this
sentence is that this person was so
difficult to find that,
because he was absent all the time.
That the sentence was made to look like a
real recommendation sentence specifically
somebody who's so valuable that people
like him are really difficult to find.
So here we have an instance of
what is known as lexico ambiguity.
So the word hard to find, I'm sorry,
the phrase hard to find has multiple,
interpretations.
In one case it means,
somebody who is very valuable.
In the other case it means
somebody who's hiding.
Here's some more examples
of lexico ambiguities.
For dishonest employee can say
he's an unbelievable worker.
He's unbelievable here
is the ambiguous word.
It can mean somebody who is so good to
believe that it's hard to believe that
person exists or it can also mean that
this person should never be believed.
For a lazy employee,
you can say you would indeed be fortunate
to get this person to work for you.
Again, he had ambiguity,
comes from the word fortunate.
In one case, it means that he will
be happy to work with such a person.
A second case,
it means that it will be a miracle
if this person got to work for you.
There are other categories of linguistic
construction that can cause ambiguity.
For example we can have structural
ambiguity, scope ambiguity, and others.
So in structure ambiguity I
will show you one example.
For chronically absent employee you
can say it seemed that his career or
her career was just taking off.
So here the ambiguity comes from
the fact that taking off can refer to
the, the fact that the career
was just starting.
Meaning that this person had even
more good things in their future or
it means that her career was just
the business of taking off from work.
In the scope ambiguity we
can look at an example of
one employee who's not worth
considering as a job candidate.
We can say, all in all, I cannot say
enough good things about this candidate or
recommend him to highly.
So here the ambiguity comes from the fact
that say enough good things can mean
that either you have only a few good
things to say about this person or
that you have way too many good
things to say about this person.
If you want to find more examples of
this kind of funny recommendations,
you can look up Beatrice Santorini's
collection on the Internet.
Okay so now in the next
segment we're going to talk
about the administration of this class.
