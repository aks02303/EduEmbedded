Okay, welcome back to
Natural Language Processing.
The next topic is going to
be on sentiment analysis.
So sentiment analysis is a very
popular sub-area of natural language
processing that has been
popularized in the last few years.
In fact, the very first papers on it
were not published until the late 90s,
and the most important contributions have
only been made in the last few years.
So what is sentiment analysis?
Let me start with an example.
So I am going to pick a book that I
particularly like by a Japanese author,
Haruki Murakami.
Suppose that I want to find what sort
of reviews were posted about this book.
By the way, the book's title is 1Q84.
What reviews have been
posted on the Internet?
So here are some examples.
From the Baltimore Examiner,
1Q84 is a tremendous feat and a triumph.
A must-read for
anyone who wants to come to terms
with contemporary Japanese culture.
Another example,
perhaps one of the most important
works of science fiction of the year.
1Q84 does not disappoint.
It envelops the reader in a shifting
world of strange cults and
peculiar characters that is surreal and
entrancing.
And finally, another example of a review.
Ambitious, sprawling,
and thoroughly stunning.
Orwellian dystopia, sci-fi, the modern
world (terrorism, drugs, apathy,
pop novels), all blend in this dreamlike,
strange, and wholly unforgettable epic.
Well, by this point it should be obvious
that those reviews are actually fairly
positive, and
if you like this kind of books you should,
based on those reviews, decide to read it.
So let's look at some of the things that
we can see in those reviews that make us
believe they are positive.
So first is the presence
of specific words and
phrases that are typically
correlated with a positive review.
So triumph, a feat,
a tremendous feat, must-read,
entrancing, ambitious,
stunning, unforgettable epic.
All of those examples of positive phrases.
In fact, there are very few negative
phrases in this example at all.
So here's another example about companies.
So there's this website that shows you
in real time the sentiment towards
different companies and their stocks.
People use this kind of information for
trading.
So you can pick some
sort of stock ticker and
observe how sentiment of that company
changes over time within days or hours.
Here are some other examples
of sentiment analysis for
things like movie reviews,
product reviews, debates.
For example, the createdebate.com website.
So there are many posts and
blogs that express sentiment.
Some of them express personal opinions.
And there are some different research
questions that we're interested in.
So one is something called
subjectivity analysis.
So before we decide whether
something is positive or negative,
we have to decide whether
it's subjective or not,
because clearly factual information is
different from subjective information.
So once we have performed subjectivity
analysis we can do polarity analysis,
essentially labeling things as
either positive or negative or
perhaps giving them a number of stars.
So let's say we read a movie review and
we'd say based on the text of the review,
we'll give it four stars out of five or
perhaps five stars.
We can also do viewpoint analysis where
there are different topics for debate.
So is this person a Chelsea fan or
a Manchester United fan?
Is this person a Republican or a Democrat?
Another research question is,
can you figure out the sentiment target?
Are you giving your opinion about
an entire product, for example,
the Apple iPhone, or about some
specific part of it, for example,
the screen or the wireless connection?
So the level of granularity
is very important.
It can be sentiment for an entire
document, for example, movie review.
It can be at the level of individual
sentences or perhaps individual
attributes, for example, the music of
a certain movie or about a specific actor.
So opinion words are important, so
there's different types of those.
There are base words, such as for
example, pretty or difficult.
They can also be comparative.
This movie's better than the other one,
or this processor is slower
than this other one.
Well, if we just count positive and
negative words, we're not going
to get a very good classifier.
So for example, just looking at
the negative words is not enough because
some of them can be negated.
So if we say something is not difficult,
that means that it's easy.
So one important component of sentiment
analysis is negation analysis,
where you take all the occurrences
of negation phrases,
such as not or didn't and so on, and
try to figure out what things they negate,
so that you can possibly
change its polarity.
We'll go back to the reviews of 1Q84.
So the second review here
includes some negative words.
For example, the word disappoint.
But in fact, if you read the review more
carefully, you will realize that is says,
does not disappoint.
So we have a negation of a negative word,
which turns the entire thing
into a positive phrase.
Okay, so
let's look now at product reviews.
So here's a website from Google
where people have written their
reviews about a specific smart phone,
Samsung Galaxy S5.
And you can see that they have
a total of 2,800 reviews.
A few have given one or two or
three stars to this product.
Quite a few have given it four stars,
and the rest have given five stars.
But what's more interesting is
that you can also have sentiment
about individual aspects of the product.
For example, its battery or
its size or its camera and so on.
And as you can see, the battery
gets the highest positive rating,
whereas the design and
the screen and the speakers and
the headset get relatively
fewer positive reviews.
So again, all this can be done
automatically by reading the reviews and
identifying polarity words
associated with a product or
with individual aspects of it.
So it's also possible to use social
media sites such as Twitter to
compute sentiment.
So there's a website
called sentiment140 where
you can see what sort of things people
say about the product on Twitter.
So again,
using the Samsung Galaxy S5 example here,
we can see that the majority of
the reviews on Twitter are positive.
So there's some important problems
that have to be resolved.
I'm not going to propose solutions for
them at this point,
I just wanted to make sure
that you know that they exist.
So problems with subtlety,
sometimes people can use some very subtle
formulations and explain what they think
about a certain target concession.
So for example, you can say maybe
this product has this problem, but
on average it's a pretty good product.
There can also be manipulation attempts,
for example,
trying to convince you
that some product is good.
People also can use sarcasm and irony,
which are very difficult to detect.
And so on.
So now let's look at sentiment
analysis as a classification problem.
We want to classify the documents or
the sentences into positive or negative.
So what kind of features can we use?
We can use individual words.
For example, whether they appear or not.
We're not interested in their frequency
because most of the time they're going to
be used just once.
Punctuation, for example, emoticons.
Phrases, the syntax of the sentence.
All of those could be valid features for
classification.
One good thing about sentiment analysis is
that a lot of training data is available.
So we can take entire websites
that have product reviews and
also look at the number of stars
that were given to that product and
use this as a training dataset.
There is a very nice dataset
from a paper by Bo Pang and
Lillian Lee at Cornell University that
has movie reviews annotated both for
polarity, positive and negative,
and also for number of stars.
So the techniques that I used
are the standard techniques used in
classification, for
example, maximum entropy or
support vector machines and naive Bayes.
So there are some very nice
resources available, for example,
the CMU Twitter parser is available
from Noah Smith's website and so on.
So this is the end of the introduction
to sentiment analysis.
In the next section we're going to look
specifically at sentiment lexicons.
