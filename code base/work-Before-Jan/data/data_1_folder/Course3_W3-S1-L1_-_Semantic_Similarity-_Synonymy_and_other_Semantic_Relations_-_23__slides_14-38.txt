Okay, the next section about
text similarity is going to be
on semantic similarity.
We're going to look at synonymy and
others and semantic relations.
I showed you this example in introduction.
There were three different announcements
about the stock market and
they all used different words, and
yet they meant more or less the same.
So climbed, gained, and rose mean pretty
much the same in the context of our
stock index going up or down.
And then, on the right hand side we
also looked at paraphrases which are,
its best close, or its best showing,
and its highest level.
Now the difference between the left
column and the right column is that
in the left one we have synonyms, and
the second case we have paraphrases.
So, what are synonyms?
This is something that you may
have studied in high school.
Synonyms are different words, and
sometimes word compounds,
that can have similar meanings.
For example, the adjectives tepid and
lukewarm, have very similar meanings
because they can be substituted for
one another in many different contexts.
For example, the water was tepid
versus the water was lukewarm.
They're not exactly the same.
There are cases where you want to
use one and not the other, but for
practical purposes they can be
substituted in most contexts.
I mentioned earlier
an example where big and
large can be synonyms in many contexts,
but not in all contexts.
For example, thereâ€™s a major difference
between the big leagues and large leagues.
Big leagues is an actual concept,
whereas large leagues is not used.
The verbs to sweat and
to perspire are also near synonyms.
But they differ in different things.
For example, the frequency of use and
the context in which they appear.
Another property of words is polysemy.
So, polysemy is the property for
words to have multiple senses.
This is what you typically
see in a dictionary.
If you open the dictionary and you look
at the definitions of the word book,
you will see that it can refer
to many different things.
It can be a literary work, for
example Anna Karenina, by Tolstoy,
that's a literary work.
It can be a stack of pages, which may or
may not be blank, for example a notebook.
It can be a record of business
transactions, think as a bookkeeper.
A bookkeeper is a person who keeps
tracks of accounts in books.
It can be a record of bets.
So a bookmaker is a person who takes bets.
And it can also be a list of buy and
sell orders in some financial markets.
So if you want to buy or a sell certain
stock, there's a list of orders and
the whole list is called a book.
There other senses of book that
I'm not going to mention here.
So the same word can also have
multiple parts of speech, and
each of those can have
its own set of senses.
For example, the word book as a verb now
can mean to make a reservation for or
to occupy.
Now the different senses of the same
word don't have to be equally frequent.
So the sense, for example,
of the word S-E-E,
as to watch something,
to observe something is very frequent.
But the sense of S-E-E as the Holy See,
where Holy,
spelled H-O-L-Y, and See, spelled S-E-E,
is only used in a very specific context,
specifically the Vatican.
The Holy See is a special name for
the Vatican.
Some of the senses of a word may overlap.
For example, the first two senses
of book in the previous slide,
remember one was literary work,
and one was a stack of pages.
So when we talk about a book we may say,
bring me the book from the shelf,
we are really talking about
a stack of pages, but
we can also be thinking about
the work of literature instead.
That's why different dictionaries have
different sets of word senses for
the same word.
In some cases, there may be a difference
between the two sizes of a word,
like title, and in other
dictionaries there may be conflict.
So a little joke here.
Somebody said, my favorite books are
Anna Karenina and my father's checkbook.
You see, in this case we have two
very different kinds of books
that are lumped together.
Now some words can be
very highly polysemous.
According to WordNet, to which we are
going to discuss in the new few slides,
the verb get has at least
35 different meanings.
Many other words in English
have many meanings.
For example, words like dull, put,
have also dozens of meanings.
There are other semantic
relationships that
are interesting to natural
language processing.
For example, antonymy, or
antonyms, means near opposites.
So for example, the word raise,
as in raise the bar, is an antonym
of lower, as in lower the bar.
Another semantic
relationship is hypernymy.
Hypernym is a more general
concept than another.
So for example, a deer is a more
general concept than an elk.
Hyponymy is the opposite of hypernymy.
In that case, we have a word that is
a more specific instance of another word.
So an elk is a hyponym for deer.
And then one more concept is meronymy.
There are two kinds of meronymy,
a membership meronymy and part meronymy.
Membership meronymy refers
to words like flock,
which includes a bunch of sheep or
possibly a bunch of birds.
That's an example of membership meronymy.
And part meronymy refers to
the relationship between a table and
its legs, because a table includes or
has legs.
Semantic relations hold between
word senses, and not between words.
For example, the antonym of
the word hot can be either mild,
if hot is used in the sense of spicy, or
cold, if hot is used in the sense of warm.
Or it can be even unattractive if hot
is used in the sense of attractive.
So depending on the sense of how
to may have different antonyms.
Another example is the following.
The immediate hypernym of
bar can be one of many.
Among others, it can be room,
musical notation,
obstruction, profession and so on,
depending on the sense of bar.
As a result, people in
the community use the term synset
to group together all
the synonyms of the same word.
If a word is polysemous, it may be
associated with multiple synsets.
So this takes us to WordNet.
WordNet is a special database
of lexical relationships between
words in English that was created at
Princeton University over the years.
It was started by George Miller,
who unfortunately passed
away a couple of years ago.
This project is now run by Christiane
Fellbaum, still at Princeton University.
It includes a large database
of words in English.
Mainly nouns and verbs, but also a
material number of adjectives and adverbs,
and it also includes the semantic
relationships between them.
The main relation in WordNet is hypernymy,
so
the overall structure of
the database is more tree-like.
The next slide will show an example of
a small subsection of the WordNet tree.
Now Wordnet is one of the most valuable
resources in natural language processing,
and I would like to encourage everybody
to look at the two references that
are listed here.
One is a collection of papers
edited by Christiane Fellbaum,
and one is an introductory article
about WordNet by George Miller himself,
in the Communications of
the ACM about 20 years ago.
So in this example,
I'm going to show you a small sub-tree
of WordNet that matches the relationship
between different animals.
So, you can see that the word
ungulate is shown on top.
Ungulates are divided into
even-toed ungulates and
odd-toed ungulates, and
all ungulates include equines and others.
I'm only showing the equines here.
Equine are mostly horses, but
other related animals also belong here,
such as mules and zebras.
And then I also have an example of an
object that is more specific than a horse,
in this case, pony.
On the left hand side, we have okapis,
deer, and giraffes, that are all examples
of ruminants, and elk, wapiti, and
caribou, which are all examples of deer.
So just to remind you,
a deer is a hypernym for caribou, and
caribou is a hyponym for deer.
Let's look at some examples of WordNet.
The word bar in WordNet has 11 senses.
They are not sorted in any particular way.
But often the first few
are the most frequent senses.
So barroom, bar, saloon,
gin mill, taproom,
are all words in the same synset as bar,
in the sense of a room where alcoholic
drinks are served over a counter.
The second sense of bar
is the actual counter
where you can purchase food or drink.
The third sense is a rigid piece of metal,
for example, an iron bar.
The fourth sense is a measure in music, so
its definition is a notation for
a repeating pattern of musical beats,
written followed by a vertical bar,
and so on.
There are many other senses of bar.
Now the verb bar, as opposed to
the noun bar, also has four senses.
Let's just look at one or two of them.
The first one is to bar, to exclude, as in
he was barred from membership in the club.
The second sense is the same as barricade,
block, blockade, block off, block up.
It means to render something
unsuitable for passage.
So barricade the streets
are to bar the streets.
In the first sense of bar,
it's closest hypernym is room.
Then the hypernym of room is area.
The hypernym of area is a structure or
construction.
Then artifact, then object,
and then entity.
So entity is one of the root
categories in the WordNet hierarchy.
I should say that WordNet
is not really a tree.
I misspoke earlier, it's more like
a forest, because it has multiple roots.
Entity or something is one of them.
I will show you some others later.
In the second sense of bar,
a bar is a hyponym of counter which
is a hyponym of a table,
a piece of furniture and so on.
And it all goes back to entity or
something.
So it goes back to the same root note.
And let's briefly look at some of
the other interpretations of bar.
So a bar is an implement.
An implement is a type of instrumentation,
and instrumentation's a type of artifact,
and now we go back to entity.
Now in the fourth sense,
we have now an abstract concept.
So bar,
in the sense of a musical notation,
is a hyponym of a notational system, which
is a hyponym of written communication,
and so on, all the way to abstraction.
So that takes us to another root
note in the WordNet forest.
If we look at some other examples.
Sense five takes us to entity, sense six
takes us to an act, a human action or
human activity, seven is again
an obstruction, eight goes to entity,
and nine goes to group or grouping,
and ten goes back to entity something.
Some other properties of words in WordNet
include familiarity and polysemy.
This slide is going to
show examples of both.
The left hand side of the slide shows you
the familiarity of certain words, and
the right hand side shows
you their polysemy.
Polysemy, as the name indicates,
means number of senses.
Poly means many.
Semy means senses.
So the polysemy count of the word
board used as a noun is nine.
For bar earlier, it was 10 or 11.
For familiarity,
the word board used as a noun is familiar.
So that's a very common category.
The other categories available are common
and uncommon, and also rare and very rare.
So the word serendipity,
for example, is very rare.
Now one thing that you may
notice based on this example,
which is also true in general,
is that more common words are also more
familiar, and also have more senses.
Like an example,
here the word board is very familiar and
it also has a high polysemy count.
So there are other lexical networks
in addition to WordNet that I want to
bring up.
Here's a sampling of those.
EuroWordNet has multiple European
languages, such as Spanish, and
French, and German.
And I would like to emphasize
that there exists many,
including many open source,
external thesauri, or language resources
that can be used in natural language
processing, in ways similar to WordNet,
and different databases that can be
incorporated in natural language systems.
For example, Open Thesaurus, Freebase,
DBPedia, BabelNet, and various thesauri.
And in case you're wondering what thesauri
means, it's the plural of thesaurus.
And thesaurus is just a special kind
of dictionary that tells you which
words are similar or
related to other words.
Here's an example of BabelNet,
this is for the word song.
As you can see, it tells you in different
languages what are the usages of this
word, and it contains links to definitions
of that word in multiple languages.
MeSH is another interesting
hierarchy of concepts.
It's used in the medical literature.
MeSH does stand for
Medical Subject Headings, and
it includes concepts such as diseases,
drugs, body parts, sera, and so on.
And the link at the bottom shows
you how you can access MeSH.
MeSH can be freely downloaded and
is used a lot in the biomedical
natural language processing community.
So this concludes the section on
WordNet and related lexical networks.
We're going to continue in
a moment with the next section,
which is on thesaurus-based
word similarity methods.
