Okay so now let's look at some of the
basic techniques for machine translation.
So one of the fundamental ideas behind
modern translation systems is that
translation is actually
just a method of decoding.
So here's a famous quote.
I want to read it aloud.
One naturally wonders if
the problem of translation
could conceivably be treated
as a problem in cryptography.
When I look at an article in Russian,
I say, this is really written in English,
but it has been coded in
some strange symbols.
I will now proceed to decode.
So this is a quote from Warren Weaver,
one of the founders of information theory.
In the book called Translation,
published in 1955, almost 60 years ago.
So here's a question for the audience.
If you know some French, at least,
look at the next two slides,
which have been translated
automatically from Google Translate and
see if you can figure out whether
the system did a good job.
And what sort of mistakes it made.
So the documents are about
a recipe in English.
So look at the next two slides and
pause as much as you need and go back and
forth between them to figure out if you
can identify the translation issues.
So here's the original recipe.
Ingredients and then directions.
So I just read one sentence here.
Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling
salted water until al dente.
And here's the automatic
translation from Google in French.
[FOREIGN].
So, let's spend a little bit of time and
see what's wrong in those translations.
And also, what works.
I'm going to show you some
examples on the next slide.
So, here's the answer.
So I want to go back for a second.
If you can see the last ingredient here,
for some reason, has the pound sign,
which is probably just the way
that Google translated one pound,
which is really funny incorrect.
Let's look at some of
the other problems here.
So I'll show you three of those.
The first one is just not
syntactically correct.
[FOREIGN] It means something
like near boiling point,
but it's grammatically incorrect.
Then the next problem is the use of
a sequence of verbs which form a very
nice parallel structure in English.
So specifically it's cook,
reduce, simmer, stir.
Stir, drain, serve.
So in English, all those verbs
appear as in imperative sentences.
Whereas in French,
the translation is somehow mixed.
It has the first one,
[FOREIGN], as an infinitive,
then [FOREIGN] as an infinitive,
and one more infinitive.
And then it switches to a noun, and
then another infinitive, and so on.
And then the last example that I want to
show you is some problem with agreements.
So [FOREIGN] is plural, and then it is
listed as [FOREIGN], which is singular.
It should have had an extra s at
the end to indicate that it's plural.
So in French,
the problem is that adjectives and
nouns have to agree with each other in
number and in gender in some cases.
So in this example we have disagreement.
So let's see what causes machine
translation systems to have problems when
they translate from one
language to another.
There are many reasons.
The first one is word order.
So some languages are subject-verb-object,
for example English and Mandarin.
Others are verb-subject-object and
others are subject-object-verb.
So obviously sentences like this when we
have languages from different word order
categories, we have to use some
syntactic information to figure out.
Where to move the subject,
and the verb, and the object.
So this is another example
with prepositions in Japanese.
So in Japanese, the prepositions
are actually postpositions.
They are actually put after the words.
Therefore to say something like,
to Mariko,
in Japanese you would say it as [FOREIGN].
Another example is inflection
with an example in Spanish.
In Spanish,
the word have can be translated in many
different ways depending on the person and
number of the verb and
also whether it is infinitive or not.
So [FOREIGN] for
example is first person singular,
[FOREIGN] is second person singular,
[FOREIGN] is first personal plural,
[FOREIGN] is third person plural,
and [FOREIGN] is the infinitive.
All those appear in English as have.
So if you want to produce a system that
translates from English to Spanish,
we have to figure out what is
the subject of have before we can
figure out the correct verb form.
So more examples.
Lexical distinctions,
again with an example in Spanish, so
here we're making a distinction between
the word use in the two languages.
So in English we say,
the bottle floated out.
Where as in Spanish the correct
translation would be [FOREIGN],
which means it left the place
by floating or while floating.
Another example in Japanese is a word
that has multiple translations,
is the word brother.
So brother in Japanese can be either
[FOREIGN], which is a younger brother,
or [FOREIGN] which is an older brother.
One more example in French,
the work they in English can be
translated as either [FOREIGN] or
[FOREIGN] depending on whether
the group is feminine or masculine.
So, more example on the next slide.
So, word order in phrases.
So for example in French,
the adjective typically follows the noun.
So, you say, [FOREIGN], the blue house.
Where the noun is before
the verb in French, and so
the noun is before
the adjective in French.
Another example is a much more complicated
word order in Japanese they have
because of the subject-verb-object
versus subject-object-verb order.
So if we want to translate I like to
drink coffee from English to Japanese.
We have the word order in
English as pronoun, subject,
followed by verb, followed by some phrase
that involves the verb and a noun.
In Japanese, you would have to
translate this as something like this.
[FOREIGN] Which means that [FOREIGN] is I,
so that stays in the right place.
[FOREIGN] is the subject marker,
which was not in English.
[FOREIGN] is the direct object for coffee.
And the object here
appears before the verb.
[FOREIGN] is the expression for to drink.
So, it's some nominalization of the verb,
to drink.
[FOREIGN] is a marker of the topic and
then [FOREIGN] is like,
which because the verb of the sentence,
it appears all the way to the end.
So, as you can imagine, translating from
English to Japanese is much more difficult
then, let's say translating from English
to a more similar language such as French.
So another example here
is vocabulary in Spanish.
So in English the word wall
can have multiple meanings.
Whether it's in internal wall or
an external wall.
So the words in Spanish for
this are [FOREIGN] and [FOREIGN].
So obviously you need to understand the
context of the document to come up with
the correct translation of wall.
And my final example is again in French.
So we can have an entire phrases that
can be substituted for single word.
So the word play in English as
a noun indicating a drama or
comedy in theaters, it's a play.
It's translated in French as [FOREIGN] or,
as you can probably guess,
something like a piece of theater.
But what's more important is that we
can have many cases where one word in
one language gets translated as multiple
words in another language or vice versa,
or maybe even multi-word expressions can
be translated as multi-word expressions,
but with a very different
internal structure.
Okay, now that we understand why
machine translation can be difficult,
let's figure out how we can build
working machine translation systems.
There are many approaches, and many of
them are based on this triangle here.
F here stands for French,
E stands for English, but
in many instances, we can just use F to
indicate any foreign language that
is being translated into English.
I stands for interlingua.
Interlingua some sort of semantic
representation of the text that is
not dependent on the underlying language.
Let's look at the different strategies.
The first one that we're going to discuss
is the so called direct approach.
The direct approach just says start from
the beginning of the foreign sentence and
then look it up in the dictionary.
One word at a time and
then translate into English.
So obviously this doesn't take into
account any of the problems that we've
discussed so far.
So you can have ambiguous words that you
don't know which translation to pick.
You can have syntactic disagreements and
so on.
So this approach was tried in the 50s and
60s before there were any powerful
computers and any language resources such
as software or
parallel data or dictionaries.
It's obviously a very naive
approach that has no way to work.
And I'm now show you two funny examples
from that time period that show
how bad it was.
In the first example, people were trying
to build a system that translates from
English to Russian, and then to figure
out if they did a good job, they manually
tried to translate back from Russian into
English to see if they get the same thing.
So, the sentence that they tried to
give was, the flesh is weak, but
the spirit is strong.
So, when the sentence got translated
into Russian and back into English,
people were scared to see that
the translation went like this,
the meat is rotten, but
the vodka is very good.
So as you can see that this
is a very bad translation,
but you can see why the system
would make such a mistake.
And the other funny example from that
time is to translate this expression,
out of sight, out of mind.
So it went to Russian and back and
then it came back as blind idiot.
So you can see how bad it was.
Another approach that was developed later
is so called indirect transfer method.
In the transfer method you have
some set of grammatical rules
that apply to different
pairs of languages.
So for example, in French,
the adjective follows the noun.
In English,
the noun follows the adjective, so
you can have rules like this and then once
you identify the adjectives and the nouns,
you can at least translate
them in the right order.
A third approach is to use
something called interlingua.
So interlingua is when you translate,
let's say the foreign language into some
logical form, for example,
in the first order logic or modal logic.
And then you use some generation to
translate back from that interlingual
representation to your target language.
So here's some examples.
If you want to translate this is
a blue house, with a direct approach,
you would translate each word separately.
With transfer we would make sure at least
to get blue and house in the right order.
And with interlingua would have some
sort of logical representation.
H is a house and H is blue.
And then use generation to
produce the English version.
So in the next segment we're going
to look at noisy channel methods for
machine translation which form the basis
of modern translation technology.
