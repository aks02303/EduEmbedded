So one of the most important aspects
of natural language processing is how
it is related to the study
of linguistics or language.
So the next segment I'm going to
go over the basics of language and
language analysis and
linguistics as they relate to this class.
So linguistics is the study of language
and it covers many aspects of language.
For example, its sound system,
its syntactic system, its use,
its change over time.
Let me start now by showing
you some slides that relate to
the sounds of the language.
The first chart is the IPA or
International Phonetics Association Chart
of consonants.
So, each consonant sound can be
characterized by two properties.
One is the so-called
place of articulation.
Which are organs, which portions
of organs I use to produce it, and
one is the manner of articulation,
which is the way the air goes through your
mouth and nose to pronounce that sound.
So let's look at some examples.
The first column includes
the sounds like puh, buh and
muh, which are known
collectively as bilabials.
Bilabial stands for two lips, you use
both lips to pronounce puh, buh, muh.
You also have sounds that are pronounced,
for example,
with your soft palate like velar
sounds like kuh and guh and ung.
And you also have a velar sounds and
palatal sounds and uvular sounds.
Uvular sounds are sounds that
are pronounced using your uvula,
which is this little portion of your
palate all the way in the back.
Now the manner of
articulation can be pulsive.
Will likely have a flow of air
that suddenly stops when you
say it sounds like pu, bu, tu, du, ku, gu,
it can also be nasal if it goes through
the nose like the [SOUND] sounds.
It can also be fricative if there
is friction when it is pronounced,
for example that covers the sounds
like [SOUND] [SOUND], and
the third property of consonants is
whether they're voiced or voiceless.
So, for example,
in each pair, in each box,
you have as many as two
different consonants.
For example, pu and bu.
They're pronounced exactly the same way
as far as the pace of articulation and
the manner of articulation are concerned,
but
they differ in whether they are voiced or
not.
So, if you put your finger on your
throat and you try to pronounce pu and
bu, you will realize that,
when you say bu, your vocal chords
vibrate and when you say puh they don't.
So the same things applies to all
the pairs of sounds like tuh and
duh, kuh and guh, and
shuh and juh, and so on.
Now in addition to constants,
there can be vowels, and
vowels are characterized
by two properties again,
one is where they are formed in the mouth,
the front the back, or in the middle.
And also whether your mouth is open,
closed, or somewhere in the middle.
So for example the e sound is front
vowel that is pronounced with
a relatively closed mouth,
whereas is much more open than e or
a and it's still pronounced
in the front of the mouth.
And then sounds like oh and oo
are pronounced in the back of the mouth.
So this chart, just like the previous one,
includes vowel sounds that are not only in
English, but in other languages as well.
Now, the other thing that you want
to hear about linguistics is that
languages are related.
Not all languages are related
to all other languages,
but many languages
are related to each other.
So if you look at the slide here,
you will see that the word for
night in English is very similar
to words in other languages,
such as French and German, all the way
to Albanian and Latin and Sanskrit.
The words don't look exactly the same,
but they have the same origin.
They come from a language
called Popioeuropean, or PIE,
from which all of the currently existing
in New York PIE languages originate.
So Popioeuropean doesn't exist anymore,
yet some of the words in that language
still survive to these
days like in this example.
So let's just look at how different they
can be, night in English, nuit in French,
nacht in German, noch in Russian,
nosht in Bulgarian,
noite in Portuguese and Galician,
notte in Italian, noapte in Romanian,
nakts in Latvian.
They all look relatively different and
yet they have something in common,
they all have the form that starts with
the letter n, followed by a vowel,
and then some specific consonant or
pair of consonants that
are somewhat related to each other.
So all the words in this
category are known as cognates.
A cognate is a term in linguistics that
means that words have a common ancestry.
So the language in
the European language family
that survive to this day can be grouped
into smaller categories, for example.
Bengali and
Urdu both descend from Sanskrit,
Farsi descends from Old Persian,
and both Old Persian and
Sanskrit are part of the so-called
Indo-Iranian group of languages.
Greek is descended of
the Hellenic group of languages.
Romanian, French, and
Catalan all descend from Latin,
which is a form of an Italic language.
Lithuanian, Russian,
and Polish are all part of
the Balto-Slavic group of languages.
Modern English descends from Old English,
which is a Germanic language.
German descends from Old High German,
which is another Germanic language,
and so on.
There are some non-Indo-European
languages that exist in the world.
Some of them are even spoken in Europe and
nearby countries.
For example,
Turkish is a non-Indo-European language,
it's part of the so-called Altaic family.
Finnish and Hungarian are part
of the Finno-Ugric family.
Arabic and Hebrew are part of the Semitic
family and to cover the rest of the world,
there can be also language families
from Africa and the Americas,
such as Uto-Aztecan which is spoken in
portions of North and Central America.
So this chart here shows you relative
distribution of the language families in
the world.
It's a little bit hard to
see on the screen, but
you can get the original
version from Wikipedia.
You can see that there are many
different families and
that they're distributed
all over the world.
And to give an idea of the language
diversity that exists now a days,
I would like to refer to
a website called the Ethnologue,
which covers 7,300 languages in the world,
which are grouped into all those different
families that you can see on the screen.
You see some of the families
can be very large, for
example the Austronesian
family has 1,257 languages.
Those Tunisian family of languages
are languages spoken in Australia and
islands of the Pacific.
Other large groups include Sino-Tibetan
languages, which include Chinese and
other related languages.
Languages from Papua New Guinea
are very common,
in fact Papua New Guinea is one of the
places in the world, along with Indonesia,
that has the largest number
of different languages.
Another subject that linguists study
is the change of language over time.
So I'll give you some examples here.
One specific example is Grimm's Law.
Grimm's Law tells you how
words in a wide range of
languages changed over the years
in a very systematic way.
So what used to be voiceless stops
turned into voiceless fricatives.
What used to be voiced stops
became voiceless stops.
And finally,
what used to be voiced aspirated stops,
aspirated are the ones that I pronounce
with an aspiration like [SOUND],
those changed to either voiced stops or
fricatives.
So, there are two examples here.
So, Example 1 shows you how
one of those changes occurred
in a variety of languages.
For example, the pu sound that
appeared in Ancient Greek, Latin, and
Sanskrit changed into an F
sound in English, German,
and Swedish, so the word foot
is listed in all those examples.
The second example is the word for
dog, which used to start
with the letter K in Ancient Greek,
Latin, and even Welsh nowadays, but
it has changed in English, Dutch,
and German to the sound huh.
Now is a good time to show you a NACLO
problem about related languages and
language cognates.
The name of this problem
is All in the Family, and
it was used in the 2012 contest.
So when you have time,
try to solve this problem,
and then on the next slide you
will see a link to the solution.
So here is the solution to
the problem All in the Family,
which has to deal with related
families of languages and cognates.
Now, going back to the idea
of language change,
I'm going to show you a very
ancient piece of text.
And I'm going to ask you if you can guess
the source of this text, the language, and
its period.
You will see the solution
on the next slide.
Well, the answer is that this is Beowulf,
which is an epic poem
that was written in the 8th to
11th century in Old English.
And it's a little hard to
read the manuscript, so
instead what I would do is show you
the text in a way that is easier to read.
The left-hand side of the slide shows you
the text as it appeared in Old English,
and the right-hand side shows
you an approximate translation
into modern English.
You can see that even though modern
English descended from Old English,
it is very different from it, and
it's very difficult to recognize
most of the words in Old English.
Now I should also say that modern English
did not just descend from Old English.
It also borrowed many words from related
languages, such as French and German and
so on, over the years after that.
The only word that is easy to
recognize here is still fairly arcane.
This is the word aerest as
in erstwhile in English.
It means first, and
that is highlighted in boldface in
the middle of each of the two texts.
If you're interested in how English
changed from Old English to modern
English, you can go through the list
of links at the bottom of the page.
This slide shows you just a few of the
examples of the words that used to exist
in Old English but are not commonly
used these days in modern English,
or have changed their meanings completely.
For example, a settle, S-E-T-T-L-E,
used to mean a seat or bench, but
nowadays we use the verb to settle,
but we don't use settle as a noun, and it
certainly it does not mean seat or bench.
So languages in different families and
even languages within the same
family can be very diverse.
For example, some languages
have articles and some don't.
This why native speakers of Russian often
have a hard time when they speak English
because there is no concept of an article,
words like the and a, in Russian.
So for Russian speakers, it can be
sometimes very difficult to say whether
you should say, I have an apartment,
or you should say, I have apartment.
Different languages can also have cases.
So case is an indication that the word
can be used in different
syntactic roles in the sentence.
For example, in Latin, you can have
a sentence like the one shown here,
Puer puellam vexat, where puer means boy,
puellam means girl, and vexat is
a form of the verb to vex or to annoy.
So here, the order of the words in
the sentence is not really important.
What is more important is that first word,
puer, appears in the so-called
nominative case, which indicates
the subject of the sentence.
Whereas the middle word, puellam,
indicates that puella is
in the accusative case or is the object of
the verb, and finally vexat is the verb.
So here, by combining all
this information together,
we know it is the boy who is annoying
the girl and not the other way around.
In English, the only way to
express this is to use word order.
In Latin, you can replace the order of
those words with a different word order,
and you will still get the same
semantics because the meaning
of the semantic roles is carried
by endings of the cases.
Languages can also differ
in their sound systems.
For example, some languages have
what is known as a glottal stop.
So this is the middle sound in uh-oh.
So this is something that appears in
some of the languages and not in others.
There are other sounds that don't
exist in English, for example,
the so-called velar fricatives.
They are articulated with the back
of the tongue at the soft palate.
So, examples of those sounds include
the voiceless velar fricative, [SOUND],
which is used in languages like Russian,
and the voiced, [SOUND], which is used
in languages such as Modern Greek.
Both of those don't exist in English.
Examples in English would include
the two th sounds, the voiceless
the and the voiced the, which don't
appear in many other languages.
And again, that can be a problem for
native speakers of other languages.
And that's why, sometimes,
people make fun of the way French
people speak when they say zis and zat
because they are not used to pronouncing
the th sound in English proper.
Languages can also differ in the way that
they refer to people in
the structure of a family.
For example, otousan in Japanese
means somebody else's father,
and chichi means somebody's own father.
This can be very problematic for
an English speaker who goes to Japan and
wants to refer to somebody
else's father as chichi.
This would be considered rude, or
at least a sign that this
person is not a native speaker.
Kinship systems in general
can be very complicated.
So English has uncles and aunts and
daughters-in-law and so on, but
some languages have more than 100
different ways to refer to your relatives.
In fact, one of the most complicated
kinship systems comes from a language
called Warlpiri.
And this brings us to the next
NACLO problem by Alan Chang,
which is listed on this website.
If you go and
try to solve this problem on your own,
you will realize that this language
is related to a specific community of
people that has different
castes which can intermarry.
But then the descendants of people from
the different caste can have different
names depending on how many generations
have happened since the intermarriage.
And the solution to this problem is here.
The next topic in linguistics that I would
like to talk about is the concept of
language universals.
So those are properties that are valid
across all languages in the world.
There are two types of language
universals, unconditional and conditional.
And I'm going to go through some of
the examples of those Language Universals.
For example,
an example of an unconditional
Language Universal is that all
languages have both verbs and nouns.
Or that all spoken languages
have both consonants and vowels.
There are no languages that
only have consonants or
languages that only have vowels.
And then two examples of
conditional language universals.
They both come from Greenberg who's
one of the founders of the theory of
language universals.
Rule number 1 on his
list is the following.
In declarative sentences,
those are sentences that end with periods,
as opposed to question marks and
exclamation points.
So in declarative sentences with
a nominal, or noun subject and object,
the dominant order is always one in
which the subject precedes the object.
So if the subject and
the object are both nouns,
then its much more common to have
the subject precede the object.
In rule number 29 on Greenberg's list
is if a language has inflection,
it must also have derivation.
So what do those words mean?
Inflection deals with
the fact that you can change
a word by changing its morphology,
and keeping the part of speech.
For example,
if the take the world to sleep, sleep, and
you change it to sleeps, you
are inflecting it for the third person.
Has to deal with changing
the part of speech of a word by
changing its morphology.
For example, if you take the word
drink which is a noun or a verb,
you can change it to drinkable Which is
an adjective by adding a suffix able.
So to summarize rule number
29 on Greenberg's list
if a language has inflection
it always has derivation.
It's a directional or
conditional universe so
it doesn't apply in
the opposite direction.
So one website that I would recommend for
you is WALS the World Atlas
of Language Structures.
It's available online at wals.info.
It's a relatively recent project that
covers several hundred languages and
almost 200 features.
The features include things like
the order of the object and the verb.
It turns out that object receives verb
in 713 languages in the database.
Verb receives objects in 705 cases and
101 languages don't have any
particularly predominant order.
Some of the other features that
are covered in this database
are features 18 and 67.
So 18 is the absence of common consonants.
It turns out that in the database,
5 languages have been enumerated
as having no bilabial sounds, 49 have
no fricatives and 12 have no nasals.
Rule number 67 is about
the inflectional future tense.
Let me explain what that means.
In English if you want to express that
the certain verb is in the future tense we
need to use an external word like will or
shall.
So if I want to say, I sleep now,
versus I will sleep in the future,
I have to add this additional word,
I will.
Other languages, for
example, French or Latin,
actually use inflection on the verb,
just like we do inflection in English for
plural with S, or
third person for verbs in S.
In French, for example,
you can add a specific ending to the verb
to indicate that it will
happen in the future.
So based on this feature,
it turns out that you can split languages
evenly into yes and
no categories with about 110 of each.
Some of the other websites I
recommend about world languages
are included on this slide.
The first one is Ethnologue, it's a very
large website that covers about seven
thousand languages in the world.
Includes a lot of statistics and
examples of their usage.
The next site is a very long list of
the common number words like 1, 10,
100 and so on in many different languages.
And then I would like to
use this opportunity to
raise the issue of endangered languages.
It turns out there are many languages
in the world, about 7,000 of them,
but every year a few dozen
of them tend to disappear.
And by disappear, I mean that the last
speakers of that language either die
out or stop using that language altogether
and switch to a different language.
If language extinction
continues at this rate,
in 100 years, a majority of
the world's languages will have died.
So there's an effort to save
dying languages by preserving
records of them in oral and written form,
and also by producing technology that will
help people who speak or understand
those languages to continue to use them.
So this was the adult
introduction to linguistics.
The next section is going to
talk about pattern speech.
