So we're now going to start the final 
topic in this class, which is a framework 
called Global Linear Models. 
As you'll see, Global Linear Models take 
many of the ideas from Log Linear Models 
that we saw a week or two ago in the 
class, but extend them in some fairly 
radical ways. 
They are a general framework under which 
we can solve. 
Many of the natural language processing 
problems we've seen so far are tagging, 
parsing, potentially also other problems 
like translation.
