Okay, so in this next portion of the
class, we're going to look at the parsing
problem in natural language processing.
And in this lecture, we're going to
discuss context free grammars, which are a
very important formulas for natural
language parsing.
And the parsing problem is of great
importance.
It has relevance to many applications in
NLP.
And it goes back to fundamental ideas in
theoretical linguistics which are then
applied in computational models.
