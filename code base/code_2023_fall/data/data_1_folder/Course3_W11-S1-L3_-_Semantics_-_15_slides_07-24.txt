Okay, welcome back to
natural language processing.
The next segment is going
to be about semantics.
It's one of the most important areas
of natural language processing and
it ties nicely with logic.
And philosophy and
knowledge representation.
So semantics is about meaning, and it can
be defined, not just for language, but
it can also be defined for
many different things.
For example, for arithmetic expressions.
So if I give you this expression,
5 plus 2 times 4 plus 3 and I ask you,
what is the meaning of this?
Well, it's very straight-forward.
You can say 5 plus 2 is 7,
4 plus 3 is 7, 7 times 7 is 49,
therefore the meaning of
this expression is 49.
So we can build this by building
a parse tree of the sentence,
or in this case,
the arithmetic expression.
We have five and two as numbers that
can be converted to expressions.
Then we can have functors like plus so
we can combine nouns and
functors into more
encompassing expressions.
Again, expressions and functors.
Recursively until we get the top level E.
Value of the expression
which is equal to 49.
So this is nice, and
we were able to compute this 49 just
applying some recursive principles
to the original expression.
However, what if we had a variable or
an unknown value somewhere
in this expression?
For example, 5 plus 2 times 4 plus z.
Well, what would be the answer here?
Well in this case,
we can start with the same parse tree.
And we have now a z, instead of a three
in the lower right-hand corner.
And in this case, what we can see
is that the value at the top level,
is not a number, but
it is some sort of procedure that lets
you compute the value of this, of now.
So it's a multiplication of two numbers,
each of which is the sum of two numbers.
The first one being five and two,
the second one adding four and z.
Even though we don't know the exact
value of the top level here,
we can say that it can be
obtained by using this procedure.
Once we know the value of z.
So in a sense,
we have converted this expression into
a procedure that can compute
semantics recursively.
Let's look at a different example
using natural language text,
specifically an English language sentence.
So we have something like
every human is mortal.
How can we define
the meaning of the sentence?
So representing meaning is one of
the most important aspects of semantics.
And you want to be able to
capture the meaning of linguistic
utterances using some
sort of formal notation.
So what does it mean to have meaning?
Well, linguistic meaning
can be very different from
what is known as pragmatic meaning.
So if I say it is 8 PM I just mean that
it is now 8 o'clock in the evening.
So that is the linguistic meaning.
But the sentence can also have
a different pragmatic meeting.
It may mean something like it is 8 p.m.,
which means that it is time to leave.
I can point to my watch and say it's
8 p.m., and I really mean let's go.
So semantic analysis, we want to assign
each of the word some sort of a meaning
and then combine the meanings of the words
to form the meaning of phrases and
then by extension entire sentences.
So ultimately we want to be able to
convert a sentence like I bought a book
into something like this.
There exists, objects x and y.
Where x is an instance of a buying event.
And this buying event has two arguments,
a buyer and a bought item.
The buyer is the same as the speaker,
or I.
The bought item is y, and y is a book.
So this would be a legitimate first order
logic representation of this sentence.
So we're going to first order
logic in the next two slides.
Okay, so now they have
presentation of the same sentence,
maybe something like this where we have a
record that consists of a predicate buying
and then to active two value pairs for
it's argument.
A buyer who's the speaker of the sentence
and a bought item that is a book.
Let's now introduce two important
concepts in semantics and
semantic analysis,
which we'll use later on.
One is called entailment and
the second one is called presupposition.
So what is entailment?
Entailment is when one fact
follows from one another.
So for if I say that all cats have
whiskers, and Martin is a cat.
That means that we can entail
the statement Martin has whiskers.
So the fact that Martin has whiskers
is entailed from the other two.
Another example is if I know
that Martin has whiskers and
a tail that entails the fact
that Martin has whiskers so
we can drop a tail and
still have a valid statement.
Now let's look at presupposition.
So presupposition can be better
explained with an example.
If I said The Queen of Utopia is dead
that means that we presuppose that
Utopia has a Queen otherwise
the sentence doesn't make any sense.
So now is a good point to introduce
one of the NACLO problems
of 2010 that describes entailment and
presupposition in more detail.
So this problem was written
by Aleka Blackwell and
it's available on the NACLO website.
So let me show you the problem now.
So the first part of the problem
introduces the concepts of entailment and
presupposition.
So the bottom part gives
you examples of entailment.
And then on the next slide we
have examples of presupposition.
So for example, for presupposition if I
say I regret not seeing Shaun White's
gold medal run that we suppose that
Shaun White had a gold medal run.
Otherwise it doesn't make sense.
Okay so then the questions are, for
any given pair of sentences it is
possible that you have entailment and
presupposition, or
none of the above, or just one.
So the questions is asking you to give
examples of pairs of sentences where in A,
A neither entails nor
presupposes sentence B.
The second question is to come up with
example sentences where A entails and
presupposes B.
The third example, the fourth example,
ask you for cases where either
you have proposition but
not entailment or the other way around.
So let's think about examples
of those sentences and
then you will get to see
the answers on the next slide.
So again, pulled from the NACLO website,
we have the examples of each of those four
combinations of entailment and
presupposition.
You can go through them and
understand why they were selected.
On the first page,
we have none of the above and both, and
on the second slide we have just
the one or just the other one.
Okay.
So now this concludes this introductory
segment on semantics.
