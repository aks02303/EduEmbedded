Okay, so over the next few lectures we are
going to talk about machine translation.
Machine translation is the problem of,
automatically translating from one
language to another language, it's one of
the oldest problems in artificial
intelligence, and computer science.
I think it's a fascinating, it's a very
challenging problem, and it's a problem
that clearly has huge impacts and
implications.
