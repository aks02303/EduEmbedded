Welcome back to
Natural Language Processing.
The next slide site is going to
be about information extraction.
So what is information extraction?
Well it's one of the most interesting
problems in natural language processing.
It's also one of the most
practically useful.
We usually start from some unstructured or
semi-structured data.
Unstructured refers to plain text.
Semi-structured refers to text that may
have some tables or some meta-data.
So some examples of unstructured data
include news stories, scientific papers,
maybe resumes.
And we've tried to extract entities,
events, and
relations from those documents.
So for example, we want to figure out
who did what, when, and where, and
why, and we may be able to use this
information to build a knowledge base.
For example, which companies
develop what kind of products or
which papers are about which
particular scientific topics.
So what is a named entity?
Well there are different types of those.
The most common categories are people,
locations, organizations.
Organizations can be partly divided into
things like sports teams, newspapers,
let's say New York Times, or
companies like IBM or Microsoft.
We can also have geo-political entities
like countries and continents and so on.
Named entities can be ambiguous.
So for example,
the word London can be a person,
like the last name, a city, a country,
it's a country by autonomy if you remember
from one of the earlier lectures.
We can say something like, London
decided not to get involved in the war,
where London stands for
the country that it is the capital of.
So Named Entities are very useful
because they can be used for
interfaces to databases,
question answering systems, and so on.
In addition to Named Entities we want to
be able to extract things like times and
events.
So times can be absolute expressions,
like, for example, January the 7th,
or relative expressions, for example,
like "last night" or next Thursday.
We also want to be able to
extract events and so on.
So a lot of the information
extraction tasks can be modeled
as sequence labeling problems.
So a part of speech tagging is
another sequence labeling problem.
Named entity recognition is one.
Semantic role labeling that we're going
to talk about in the future is also
a sequence labeling problem.
In sequence labelling,
the input is a sequence of words.
For example, w1, w2, w3 and
the output is a set of labelled words.
For example,
w2 is a noun that corresponds to a person.
Or maybe w2 and
w3 combined are a sequence of two nouns
that correspond to a person and so on.
So most of the time,
people use classification method for
sequence labelling.
So we can use the categories
of the previous tokens,
as features when we classify the next one.
And the direction matters, sometimes
it's better to do this left to right.
In other case,
it may be better to do it right to left.
And you can also do it by direction,
going both directions at the same time.
So one of the most interesting
points in information extraction is
Named Entity Recognition or
NER as it is known in the literature.
It consists of two parts,
segmentation and classification.
So segmentation is about determining which
words belong to a specific named entity.
So here in the sentence, Brazilian
football legend Pele's condition has
improved, according to a Thursday evening
statement from a Sao Paulo hospital.
We have three named entities, and
they're segmented properly here.
The second task in name entity
recognition is classification,
and that is once we have segmented
the text into named entities, then
the rest of the sentence we want to label
each of the named entities with it's type.
So there are different ways to do this.
We can use gazetteers,
session long lists of geographical
locations or people's names.
We can look at the spelling
of the individual word.
We can look at the words that are adjacent
or the presence of specific words.
For example, the President or Mrs. or Mr.
as hints as to how to
classify the named entity.
So this particular sentence here can
be labeled in the following way.
Pele is a person, Thursday evening
is a time expression, and finally,
Sao Paulo is a location.
Here's some more examples,
we can have organizations,
Albert Einstein Hospital
is an organization.
Thursday night, again, is the time
expression, and then we have an event,
Pele was relocated.
In this case we have an action verb,
relocate, which has a certain set of
arguments, in this case,
Pele as the person being relocated.
Information extraction and
entity recognition is very commonly
used in the biomedical domain.
Some examples include gene labeling.
So here's an example with sentence.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that
produce tumor suppressor proteins.
In this case, we want to label
the two instances of genes, BRCA1 and
BRCA2, as genes.
So this is the end of the section
on information extraction.
We're going to continue with some
additional topics related to information
extraction in the next segment.
