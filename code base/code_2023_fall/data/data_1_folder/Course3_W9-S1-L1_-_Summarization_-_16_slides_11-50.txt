Welcome back to natural
language processing,
today we're going to start a new section
on text summarization which is one of
the most interesting parts in
natural language processing.
So here is a very simple
introduction to text summarization.
We want to be able to get it's input.
A set of documents, for
example about health.
So here we have a bunch of sentences
about eating vegetables and
fruits, and
the reasons why they're healthy.
Often, users don't have the time
to read a lot of details, and
we want to be able to produce
a summary of them for two reasons.
One, so that they can read
the summary instead of the original
documents if they don't have enough time.
Or, even more realistically,
to show them the summary so
that they get an idea of what
the document is all about.
And once they've the summary
they can decide whether they
want to go and
read the full set of documents.
In this example,
the summary that we would like to get,
although there's no summarization
system currently that can do this,
we want to get a short summary like this,
eating vegetables is healthy.
Well this is a very extreme example of
text summarization, which as I said,
is not practical or
feasible at this point.
But there are many instances of existing
summarization systems that work, and
could use meaningful summaries that
are actually useful for users.
So let's look at some examples, what kind
of summaries we won't be able to produce.
One is news summarization,
we won't get, for example,
a cluster of documents that
are related to each other.
And produce a short summary like the one
that appears in the middle of the page,
of everything that happened in
the set of related documents.
We can also put as book summaries.
So here is an example,
we can have something like Cliff Notes
which probably everybody knows about.
Cliff Notes are short descriptions
of what happens in some large book,
plus some additional comments
about the characters,
and the plot, and
the techniques used in the book.
Here's a fun example, there's a website
called Book a Minute, where people have
spent time to summarize famous books
into really, really short versions.
So here's one,
can you guess which book it is?
Some boys crash on an island.
And then Ralph says repeatedly,
we need a fire.
They make a fire, it goes out.
This happens a few times.
Then Jack says, forget the fire.
Let's kill each other.
The other boys say, yeah.
And they do kill each other.
The end.
But, this is again a tongue in
cheek summary of a famous book.
Can you guess which one it is?
Yeah, so this book is, obviously,
Lord of the Flies, by Golding, and
it was author condensed, to use that term,
by David Packer and
Samuel Stoddard at rinkworks.com.
So more examples of summaries.
Movie summaries, we have some like
Titanic and short summaries of it.
For example, beginning with genuine
footage of the departure of the Titanic on
it's fateful voyage, this epic movie
tells the events of that tragic
night from the perspective
of fictional survivor Rose.
As an old lady 100 she recounts
her story of duty, love and
disaster to a salvage crew searching for
a lost gem.
Obviously there are many different
summaries that you can produce for us.
Given more obviously if you
go to a website like IMDB,
you can get hundreds of Summaries
written by different people.
And as you can see the summaries often can
look very different from one another and
yet have the same goal.
Namely, to capture the gist of
the movie or book or other piece of.
Another type of summaries,
are search engines snippets,
the difference between those and
the ones that we looked at previously is
that those are cookie based, so
search engines return little
passages from the retrieved documents
that are most similar to the query.
So here's an example.
I did a search for cloud atlas,
which is a science fiction book.
And as you can see the top hits
that are returned here by Google
are all accompanied by short passages or
snippets.
And the words cloud atlas and
the name of the author are highlighted.
There are many different
genres of summaries.
We have also headlines,
as our headline can be construed as
a very short summary of a document,
of a new story, for example.
An outline can be produced from many
different genres of documents which could be
an outline of a book,
an outline of a meeting,
an outline of an encyclopedia entry or
paper and so on.
It can also be minutes of meetings,
biographies of people from obituaries or
just plain biographies.
They can be abridgments.
Some abridgments of books
are typically shorter versions.
For different audiences,
perhaps for younger children or
for people who don't have that much time.
They can be sound bites,
which are just some small
snippets of audio from an interview or
from some event.
They can be movie summaries,
chronologies and so on.
And I want to give credit for this
taxonomy to Gidget Mani and Mark Maybury.
From the '99 paper.
So what types of summaries can there be?
Well we already saw some of them, but
how do we distinguish between
the different types of summaries?
Well one of the factors
is what's the input?
Is it single document or
multiple documents?
Is it Grammatical text or
not, was the output,
is it a grammatical sentence or
does it have just a few keywords?
Is it speech or text?
What's the purpose?
Is it intended to replace the original
document, or is it just indicative,
in which case, it just tells you what
the original document is about but
doesn't give you all of
the details about it.
They can also be something called critical
summaries, where you are summarizing for
example a book or a movie, but
you're also giving some subjective
information about how you feel about it.
The form can be either extractive or
abstractive.
So extracts are usually like a
representative paragraphs or sentences or
phrases from a document, where abstracts
can be reformulated using different words.
And I in general,
to quote a Paice paper from 1990,
A Concise Summary Sample Subject Matter
of a Document.
There are other dimensions to take into account.
What are the document summaries based
on the single multiple document input?
The context is very important.
Is it query specific?
For example, how is this document related
to, let's say trade talks versus generic.
What's generically a good summary of
this document regardless of the context?
Okay, so a typical summarization
system can have up to three stages.
Typically there are the following.
The first stage is content identification,
so given your input document, you have to
determine what information you want to
preserve and pass on to the next stage.
So that could be some specific sentences,
or named entities, or facts.
The next thing is how to
organize this information.
You want to combine information
from multiple documents,
do you want to preserve entire sentences?
Do you want to reorder them?
And finally you have realization.
So in realization you have to
deal with some additional issues.
For example, if you take two documents and
you do one sentence from each of them,
they may not read nicely
next to each other.
So it's possible that the realization
stage would include the generation of some
connectives.
For example, for example, or therefore,
or in contrast so that the sentences.
that came from different sources can
be tied together more coherently.
Or realization can include the generation
of some referring expression,
such as this person or he or she.
So here's an example of
an extractive summarizer.
It takes as input a news story.
As you can see, the news story
consists of about ten sentences.
And then we want the summary to
include the most important facts
that are underlined and shown in red here.
You can see that a purely extractive
summarizer would just underline those
passages and sentences and
present that as the summary.
So this case realization is practical and
non-existent because we are just
preserving information from the original
documents as it appears in exactly the
same order One important thing to mention
here is that extracting summarization
can come into different kinds.
The first kind is where you have
only full sentences, like for
example the last sentence
in this example here.
Or you can have portions of sentences,
that still counts as an extracted
summarizor even if you're not
extracting the entire sentences.
So it turns out that summarization is
something humans had been doing for years.
For example there are professional
abstractors that read scientific articles
and create manual abstract of those that
go into different diplomatic databases.
And here's a nice quote from many years
ago from 40 years ago by Ashworth
about what professional abstractors do.
Quote unquote.
To take an original article, understand
it and pack it neatly into a nutshell
without loss of substance or
clarity, presents a challenge
which many have felt worth taking up for
the joys of achievement alone.
These are the characteristics
of an art form.
So this passage very clearly indicates
that summarization is a very difficult
task that humans may or
may not be good at.
But that it involves some very
significant amount of craftmanship.
Okay, let's now focus on some specific
types of summaries, for example,
extractive summarization.
So as I mentioned before extractive
summarization is about selecting
units of the original text and presenting
in the order at which they appear there.
The units are usually sentences with one
of the most common scenarios there is no
simplification of the sentences allowed.
So you're not allowed to skip any portions
of them or replacing words with others.
No rewriting is allowed, so it turns out
that for some genres of documents, this
is a very important baseline that is very
hard to meet for extractor summarization.
And that is the so
called lead-base baseline.
So in lead-based summaries
we have a certain amount of
text that you are allowed to
produce as part of the summary.
For example, let's say the equivalent
of two sentences or five sentences.
So the baseline is to
extract as many sentences for
the beginning of the document as you
are allowed to produce in the output.
So 205 in this example.
It turns out many of innovation metrics
and for many genres of text the first
sentences in the document are in
fact the most informative sentences.
Well, luckily for researchers in this
field, this is not the case in most of
the other genres, so it's possible to come
up with techniques that are even better.
So we're going to now
continue with some additional
considerations about some
organizations in the next segment.
