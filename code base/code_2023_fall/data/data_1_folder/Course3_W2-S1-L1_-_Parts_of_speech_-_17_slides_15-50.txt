So, the next segment is going to be
about the different parts of speech
that exist in language.
So let's look at the first example here.
We have a sentence like,
Nathalie likes black cats.
We can replace the word
black with Persian, tabby,
or small and
still have sentences that make sense.
Nathalie likes tabby cats or
Nathalie likes Persian cats.
Well, it's a single word and
it can be used in the same position
those are usually referred to
as the same syntactic category.
In this case, the syntactic category,
the part of speech is, because it's
a single word, is an adjective.
There are many other syntactic categories
in, in English and other languages.
So, those include open and
closed categories.
Open categories include
the categories that
can have new words added
to them over time.
So for example, a no-fly-zone
is a noun and twerk is a verb.
And, those words were added to
the vocabulary of English in the relative,
recent past.
We also have closed functional
categories such as the, and in,
which are respectively determiners or
articles and prepositions.
Let's look at an example sentence,
the dog chased the yellow bird.
We have multiple parts of speech here,
article, noun,
verb article, adjective, and noun.
So in English, there are about eight
general types of parts of speech.
We looked at some of them already,
nouns and verbs and adjectives.
So, what do those have in common?
So, the nouns include things like dog,
tree, computer and idea.
They can be either concrete like
the first three or abstract.
They can vary in number,
singular and plural, in gender and
in case, not in English but
in other languages.
For example, in Latin, the same word,
puer, which means boy,
can be spelled in many different ways.
In the singular, one boy can be puer, in,
which is the so-called nominative case or
subject case.
Puerum, which is the accusative object,
and pueri,
which is the genitive, of the boy.
In the plural, we can have pueri, which
is the nominative again, subject form.
We can have pueros,
which is the accusative.
And finally, puerorum,
which is the genitive, of the boys.
Now, the gender doesn't need to match the
actual sex of the object being described.
So, a typical example that people
give is the word in German, madchen.
The word madchen means girl.
And because it's a diminutive the chen
part indicates that it's a small person.
The word is neuter in gender, in German,
even though it refers to a female person.
Now, let's look at one of the most famous
examples in courses of this nature.
It's a short poem extracted from
Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland,
and more specifically,
the second part of the book.
You may have seen this before, but
if you haven't see it, you will
realize that this is in gibberish.
Most of the words are not valid English
words, and yet, it is possible for
a speaker of English to understand at
least the parts of speech of those words.
Even though, in some cases,
this can be tricky.
So, let's try to do this together.
I want to give you a minute now to figure
out the parts of speech of the words
in boldface.
So, let's look at the answer
to the previous question,
what are the parts of speech
of the words in boldface?
The first word is wabe and borogoves.
So, those are most likely nouns,
and how do we know this?
Well, they both follow the word the.
In English, typically after the word the,
you have a noun.
Next one is a little trickier, brillig,
what kind of part of speech is this?
Well, for your first guess is that this is
an adjective, but it could also be a noun.
Let's look at the examples.
It could be something like, an adjective,
like it was early, or
it can be a noun, as in, it was noon.
So, in either case we don't know
exactly the part of speech, but
we know it's one of those two.
What about mimsy?
Well, mimsy's most likely
an adjective because of
the way it appears in the sentence.
Now, what about the slithey towes?
Well, this is either an adjective and noun
combination, the same as small people.
Or it can also be a noun and verb
combination, similar to the bell tolls.
Finally, we have the expression
mome rahs ougrabe.
So, this could be a combination
of adjective, noun and verb.
But it could also be a combination
of noun, verb and adverb.
As in birds fly outside.
So, the point here is that in some cases,
you can guess the part of speech of
an unknown word based on the context, but
in other cases this can be,
still, very tricky.
And the reason why this is an important
example is that it mimics what
computers do with human language, they see
text that they really don't understand.
The see seq, sequence of words and
if they don't have enough prior
knowledge about that language or
about the words themselves, they
wouldn't be able to understand anything.
So in that case, what they do is
they either use prior knowledge or
they reason probabilistically.
So, there may be a rule in
the system that says, after a the,
the next word is a noun with
the probability of 99%.
And, after an adjective,
the next word is a noun with
a probability of 80% and so on.
And then, when you combine all the
probabilities of the sentences that you
observe, you can come up with the best
estimate that is consistent with
the rules that you know and
the text that you have seen.
It is also important to use context.
So if, for example,
you have a word that is ambiguous maybe in
the context you can see other related
words that help you disambiguate it.
So, for example, if you use the word, bar,
in a sentence, and the whole text talks
about legal issues and lawyers and
people finishing law school.
It's more likely that this use of
the word bar is in the legal sense,
rather than the establishment,
restaurant-type of sense.
And also, computers can be wrong.
So, they can make a mistake and
this can propagate in the whole system.
For example,
they can ignore a negation and
then assume that the opposite of
what was said is actually true.
The next category of parts
of speech is pronouns.
In English, they include things like she,
ourselves and mine.
Pronouns vary in person first, second and
third gender, masculine and
feminine, number and case.
English actually has cases for
pronouns, and that includes nominative,
accusative, possessive and
second possessive.
So more specifically,
that could be I, me, my, and mine.
And, pronouns can also have reflexive and
anaphoric forms.
So, for example,
if I say Samantha gave her a haircut,
her must refer to a different person.
Whereas if I say,
Samantha gave herself a haircut then,
she gave the haircut to Samantha.
So, this is a, a reflexive pronoun.
The other categories of parts of speech
in English include determiners and
adjectives.
Determiners are things like articles and
demonstratives, things like the,
this, that.
And, adjectives include words
that describe properties.
They can be used either attributively or
predicatively.
So, small house is attributive,
and the house is
small that second example,
small is used predicatively.
Adjectives agree in gender and
number in different languages.
And, they can have a positive form,
such as short and
also comparative and superlative
form such as shorter and shortest.
And, those comparative and
superlative forms can be either
derivative or periphrastic.
Derivative is when you have form
like small, smaller, smallest,
or a periphrastic is difficult,
more difficult, most difficult.
The next category of parts
of speech is verbs that are,
includes words that describe
actions such as throw.
Activities such as walk and
states, such as have.
There are four verb forms in English,
other languages can have
many more than that.
The tenses are present, past and future,
and different variants of those.
Other inflection that exists in
English includes, number and person.
And, verbs can also include gerunds
such as ing forms and infinitives.
That's the form of the verb
that follows the word to.
Verbs can also be
distinguished by their aspect.
They can be either progressive or
perfective,
depending on whether the action
is to continue or not.
And finally, they can be
distinguished based on their voice.
So, in the sentence I bought a house
the verb bought is in the active voice,
whereas in, a house was bought,
the word bought is in the passive tense,
a passive voice, sorry.
So, some other things about verbs is that
they can include things like participles,
ed forms, for example, and auxiliaries,
words like may and will, and shall.
Verbs can have different arguments.
Those are the words that
come after the verb and
indicate some modifications to the verb.
For example, the dog sleeps is
an instance of an intransitive verb.
There's no direct object.
That's what intransitive means.
The dog chased the cat, in that example,
the word chased is a transitive verb
because it has a direct object.
And finally, in the sentence,
Mary gave
the dog a bone,
we have an example of a ditransitive verb.
That's a verb that takes two objects,
gave somebody something.
And, you can also have things like
irregular verbs, so, slept and caught.
Now, what I said so
far applies mostly to English.
Other languages have
much richer inflections
the examples that you may be familiar with
include languages like French and Latin.
Which have more than 100 different forms
of a certain verb, and languages like
Finnish which have many different forms,
sometimes more than 20, of the same noun.
So here's an example of a much more
sophisticated inflectional paradigm for
verbs.
This is an example from French.
On this slide alone, there are 36
different forms of the verb, to go.
And, I can promise you that
there are at least two more
slides that I can show you which
have even more forms of the verb.
Depending on whether it's in present and
past and continuous form.
Or whether it's in a different mood
such as conditional and subjunctive.
And now, just to conclude the,
the list of parts of speech.
The other parts of speech in English
include adverbs, things like happily,
which describes a manner.
Here, which describes a location,
and never, which describes a time.
Prepositions, particles.
So, particles can sometimes be
confused with prepositions but
there's a very important test
that can tell them apart.
Particles are usually used in the form
of the so-called phrasal verbs.
So, a phrasal verb could
be something like take off,
take off is not some special way of
taking, it's a completely different verb.
Or I wanted to take up this
matter with the principal, so
again, take up is a phrasal verb, and
in the two cases that I just showed you.
Off, with two f's and up, are particles
that are part of the phrasal verbs.
And, there's the test that I mentioned,
can be used to distinguish between
prepositions and particles.
A common example that people use is, she
ran up a bill versus she ran up a hill.
In the first example, she ran up a bill,
ran up is a phrasal verb.
Whereas in the second example,
she ran up a hill,
up a hill is a prepositional phrase,
and up is not associated with the ran.
And, the way to tell the two
apart is very simple.
Can we move up and
the rest of the sentence to the beginning?
So, we can say, she ran up a hill.
Up a hill, she ran.
So, that sounds like a valid paraphrase,
therefore,
we have an instance of a preposition.
But, we can not do the same thing with,
she ran up a bill.
We can not say, up a bill, she ran,
which means in this example, run and
up are parts of the same word.
Parts of the same verb,
rather, and cannot be split up.
In that case, up is a particle.
The other conju, the other parts of
speech we haven't talked about include
coordinating conjunctions such as and,
or, and
but, which are used to connect
similar parts of the sentence.
For example, apples and oranges.
Subordinating conjunctions,
which are used to connect
different portions of
the sentence that are not equal.
For example, I can have an entire sentence
be inserted by preceding it with the word,
that.
So, I can say, I will not go home
unless you give me money.
So, in that example, unless introduces an
entire relative clause, you give me money.
But, I cannot switch the order of
the two parts of the sentence and
obtain the same meaning.
And, finally, we have interjections.
Those are things like sounds,
like meow or ouch.
And, to conclude this section, I would
like to show you the labels that I use
in part of speech tagging in
natural speech processing.
So, part of speech tagging is the process
of automatically assigning parts of speech
to words.
And, most of the existing
part of speech taggers and
natural language parsers
use this convention.
So, NN is a shorthand for a singular noun.
NP is a shorthand for proper noun.
And then, S is for plural noun and so on.
The first letter in each code tells you
the part of speech, so whether it's N or
J or N or C or R or V, and
the second and third letters,
if any, tell you something a little
bit more detailed about that word.
For example, VB is an uninflected verb.
VBN is the EN or
passive perfective form of the verb,
such as taken or
looked used as a past participle.
And, VBD stands for
a verb used in its past tense,
such as took or looked, as I looked out,
versus the previous sentence where
looked was used in a passive voice.
So, this concludes the section
on part of speech tagging, and
the next section is going to be
on morphology and the lexicon.
